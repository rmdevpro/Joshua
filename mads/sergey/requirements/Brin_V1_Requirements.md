## Conversation History

### Document MAD Naming Discussion

**User:** we create sergey and so I think gates should be changed to be identical to sergey Except for Microsoft Doc and then we should use the existing Gates (renamed) for open source docs. Each needs an imperator that you can ask to create and manipulate docs

**Assistant:** Got it! Restructuring:
- Sergey (Google Docs)
- Gates (Microsoft Office)
- New MAD for open source

**User:** no no, we already created Sergey, he deals with Google docs, Gates would deal with Microsoft Docs and a third that would deal with open source docs (needs a name)

**Assistant:** Ah, corrected! Name suggestions for open source: Stallman, Torvalds, Raymond

**User:** Stallman is fine

**User:** Actually in keeping with the way the names work, V1 sergey should be cahnged to V1 Brin when we build it. Keep it in the same place, dont create a directory now, just put in the requirments

**Assistant:** Renamed to Brin - after Sergey Brin, Google co-founder.

Brin V1 is a MAD specialized in creating and manipulating Google Workspace documents. This version adds an **Imperator** to enable users to manage Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides through simple, conversational requests.

**2. Key Features & Functional Requirements**

*   **FR1: Add Imperator:** Integrate an LLM brain into Brin that can understand natural language instructions for document creation and editing.
*   **FR2: Conversational Interface:** Introduce a new MCP tool, `brin_converse`, to accept document-related requests.
    *   *Examples:* "Brin, create a report summarizing our Q1 results," "Update that slide deck with the new architecture diagram," or "Make a spreadsheet to track our MAD development progress."
*   **FR3: Multi-Format Support:** Brin must be able to create and edit documents across the Google Workspace suite: Docs, Sheets, and Slides.
*   **FR4: Preserve Existing Tools:** Any existing, non-conversational tools for document manipulation must remain functional.

**3. Technical & Integration Requirements**

*   **TR1: LLM Client Library Dependency:** Brin V1 requires integration with the shared **LLM Client Library** to implement its Imperator.
*   **TR2: Google Workspace API Integration:** Brin must be securely authenticated with and use the official Google Workspace APIs to perform all document operations.

**4. Out of Scope for V1**

*   Complex formatting, charts, or embedding objects.

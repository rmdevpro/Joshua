Excellent. I have thoroughly reviewed the provided code in `tools.py` and `proxy_server.py` against the list of fixed issues.

Here is a detailed verification and confirmation:

### **Verification of Fixed Issues**

#### 1. ✅ **Binary message handling**
- **Location:** `proxy_server.py`, in `SpyWorker.relay_client_to_upstream` and `SpyWorker.relay_upstream_to_client`.
- **Implementation:** The code correctly checks if a message is `bytes`. It then enters a `try...except UnicodeDecodeError` block. If the bytes can be decoded as UTF-8, they are logged as a string. If not, a safe, informative fallback message `"[Binary data: {len(raw_message)} bytes - cannot decode as UTF-8]"` is generated for logging.
- **Correctness:** This is the ideal implementation. It ensures that the logging system never crashes on binary data while still providing a useful record that binary data was transmitted. Crucially, the original `raw_message` (whether `bytes` or `str`) is always forwarded, ensuring the proxy remains transparent and does not corrupt the data stream.
- **Verdict:** **Correctly addressed.**

#### 2. ✅ **Upstream validation**
- **Location:** `proxy_server.py`, in `SpyWorker.start` and `SpyWorker.get_upstream_url`.
- **Implementation:** The `SpyWorker` class now has a class-level dictionary `ALLOWED_UPSTREAMS` which acts as a strict whitelist. The `get_upstream_url` method checks against this list (case-insensitively). If the requested upstream is not found, it returns `None`. The `start` method checks this return value and, if invalid, constructs a clear error message and closes the client WebSocket with the specific code `4001` and a descriptive reason.
- **Correctness:** This is a robust security and validation fix. It prevents the proxy from being used to connect to arbitrary, unapproved WebSocket servers. The error feedback to the client is immediate, specific, and uses the correct WebSocket closing protocol.
- **Verdict:** **Correctly addressed.**

#### 3. ✅ **Redundant updated_at**
- **Location:** `tools.py`, in `dewey_store_message` and `dewey_store_messages_bulk`.
- **Implementation:** After successfully inserting a message (or messages in bulk), a dummy update statement is executed: `await conn.execute("UPDATE conversations SET id = id WHERE id = $1;", conv_id)`.
- **Correctness:** This is a clever and efficient database pattern. It leverages the database's `ON UPDATE` trigger to set the `updated_at` timestamp without needing to fetch the current time in the application, format it, and send it back to the database. This reduces application logic and network overhead while guaranteeing that the timestamp is updated atomically within the same transaction. The fix is applied consistently in both single and bulk message storage functions.
- **Verdict:** **Correctly addressed.**

#### 4. ✅ **Force parameter**
- **Location:** `tools.py`, in `dewey_delete_conversation` and `dewey_delete_startup_context`.
- **Implementation:** Both functions now begin with an explicit check: `if not force:`. If the `force` parameter is not `True`, a `ToolError` is raised with a clear message explaining that `force=True` is required. This check happens before any database operations are attempted.
- **Correctness:** This is a critical safety feature implemented perfectly. It creates a "safety interlock" that prevents accidental data deletion, forcing the caller to be explicit about their destructive intent.
- **Verdict:** **Corrected addressed.**

### **Overall Confirmation**

#### All fixes are correctly implemented
Yes. Each of the four fixes is implemented robustly, follows best practices for its domain (e.g., database patterns, WebSocket protocol, error handling), and fully resolves the underlying issue.

#### No new bugs introduced
I have analyzed the changes in context and have not identified any new bugs or regressions. The fixes are well-contained and do not have unintended side effects on other parts of the system. In fact, the changes have made the system more resilient, secure, and efficient.

#### Code is production-ready
**Yes, the code appears to be production-ready.** My reasoning is based on the following observations beyond the specific fixes:

-   **Security:** Use of parameterized SQL queries throughout `tools.py` prevents SQL injection. The upstream whitelist in `proxy_server.py` is a critical security control.
-   **Performance:** The use of `UNNEST` for bulk inserts and the optimized `LEFT JOIN` for listing conversations in `tools.py` demonstrate a strong focus on database performance.
-   **Robustness:** The error handling is solid. The proxy's logic to forward messages even if logging fails is an excellent choice for production resiliency. Database operations are correctly wrapped in transactions.
-   **Clarity & Maintainability:** The code is well-structured, commented, and uses clear variable names and helper functions (e.g., `_validate_uuid`, `_serialize_item`). Logging is informative and consistent.
-   **Configuration:** Key limits (`MAX_CONTENT_SIZE`, `MAX_BULK_MESSAGES`) are defined as constants, making them easy to manage.

### **Conclusion**

**Verification confirmed.** All specified issues have been correctly and effectively resolved. The implemented solutions are robust, and the overall quality of the code is high, meeting the standards for a production-ready system.

Of course. This is an excellent and well-documented bug report. Here is my analysis and set of recommendations.

### Executive Diagnosis

The evidence strongly indicates that the problem is not with the Fiedler MCP server, the Docker configuration, or the underlying network. The successful `wscat` test is the definitive piece of evidence that proves the WebSocket endpoint is fully functional and accessible from the host machine.

The failure is therefore isolated to the **Claude Code client application itself**. The core issue is likely one of the following, in order of probability:

1.  **Configuration Loading/Precedence:** Claude Code is not reading the configuration file you are editing, or another configuration file is taking precedence. The lack of any connection attempt in the Fiedler logs strongly supports this hypothesis.
2.  **Application Sandboxing:** Claude Code, if installed via a method like Snap or Flatpak, may be running in a security sandbox that is preventing it from making local network connections, even though other tools (`wscat`) on the same machine can.
3.  **Internal Client Bug:** There may be a bug within Claude Code's specific WebSocket client implementation that causes it to fail silently before ever establishing a TCP connection.

The lack of any logs from Claude Code is the most critical and revealing symptom. It suggests the connection logic is either never being triggered or is failing silently at a very early stage.

### Direct Answers to Your Questions

1.  **Why would Claude Code's MCP WebSocket client fail when wscat succeeds?**
    This happens when the issue is client-side. `wscat` is a simple, robust tool. Claude Code is a complex application. The failure point is likely in the code *before* the network socket is even opened: parsing the config, checking permissions, or an internal logic error. `wscat` proves the server and network are innocent.

2.  **Is there a known incompatibility between Claude Code and WebSocket MCP transport?**
    Unlikely to be a fundamental incompatibility, as WebSocket is a standard transport. It's more likely an implementation-specific bug or an environmental issue (like sandboxing) that affects Claude Code but not other applications.

3.  **Should we abandon direct WebSocket and switch to Stable Relay architecture?**
    **Yes, pragmatically.** You have a working, tested, and validated alternative. The immediate goal is to restore functionality. Switch to the Stable Relay configuration to get unblocked *now*. The direct connection issue can then be treated as a lower-priority investigation.

4.  **What diagnostic information would help identify the Claude Code MCP client issue?**
    The single most useful piece of information would be **verbose application logs from Claude Code itself**. Since they are not readily available, we must force the application to reveal its state. A key technique is to **deliberately introduce a syntax error** into the configuration file to see if the application complains on startup. This will prove whether it's even reading the file.

5.  **Is there an undocumented Claude Code MCP WebSocket requirement we're missing?**
    It's possible, but unlikely to be the root cause here. Issues like missing custom headers or subprotocols would typically result in a failed WebSocket handshake, which would still generate a connection attempt visible in the Fiedler logs. Your Fiedler logs show *no connection attempts*, pointing to a problem earlier in the chain.

### Recommendations & Action Plan

#### Immediate Action: Get Operational

1.  **Switch to the Stable Relay Architecture.**
    Modify your configuration file to use the known-good Stable Relay. This will restore tool functionality immediately.

    **Configuration (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`):**
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "fiedler": {
          "transport": {
            "type": "ws",
            "url": "ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    *Note: Use `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` since Stable Relay is also running on the host.*

#### Root Cause Investigation Plan

Perform these steps to diagnose the original direct-connection issue.

1.  **Step 1: Consolidate Configuration Files.**
    The presence of two configuration files (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` and `~/.claude.json`) is a major red flag. One may be overriding the other.
    *   **Action:** Move `~/.claude.json` to a backup location (e.g., `~/.claude.json.bak`).
    *   Ensure only `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` contains the Fiedler configuration.
    *   Completely restart Claude Code and test again.

2.  **Step 2: Verify Configuration File is Being Read.**
    This is the most critical diagnostic test.
    *   **Action:** Edit `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` and deliberately break the JSON syntax (e.g., remove a trailing comma or a closing brace).
    *   Save the file and launch Claude Code from a terminal.
    *   **Expected Result:** The application should either fail to start, or print a clear JSON parsing error to the terminal.
    *   **If No Error Occurs:** This is your "smoking gun." It proves Claude Code is **not reading this file at all**. You need to find the correct configuration path for your installation.
    *   **If an Error Occurs:** This is good news. It proves the file is being read. The problem lies elsewhere (proceed to Step 3).

3.  **Step 3: Investigate Application Sandboxing.**
    *   **Question:** How was Claude Code installed? (e.g., Snap, Flatpak, AppImage, `.deb` package, compiled from source?)
    *   **If Snap:** Run `snap connections claude-code`. Look for a `network-bind` or similar plug that allows it to access local network ports. It may be disabled by default.
    *   **If Flatpak:** Run `flatpak info --show-permissions com.example.ClaudeCode` (replace with the actual app ID). Look for network permissions like `--share=network`. It may be sandboxed from accessing `localhost`.

4.  **Step 4: Search for Verbose Logging Flags.**
    *   Launch Claude Code from the terminal with common flags to increase log verbosity. This is speculative but worth trying.
    *   **Examples:**
        ```bash
        claude-code --verbose
        claude-code -v
        LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code
        ```
    *   Watch the terminal output closely for any mention of MCP, WebSocket, or the Fiedler URL during startup.

### Final Summary

The `wscat` test is your ground truth: the server is fine. Your focus must be entirely on the Claude Code client. The most probable cause is a simple configuration loading issue. By switching to the working Stable Relay to get unblocked and then systematically testing the configuration loading (Step 2), you should be able to quickly identify the root cause.

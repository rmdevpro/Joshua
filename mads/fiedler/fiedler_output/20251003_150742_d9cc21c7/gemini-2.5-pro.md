Of course. After a thorough review of the `BUG_TRACKING.md` and `CURRENT_STATUS.md` logs, here is a diagnosis of the situation and a clear plan for your next steps.

### Executive Summary

The investigation has successfully ruled out several potential causes. The configuration format is now correct, and the Fiedler service is confirmed to be healthy and responsive. All evidence points to a **network resolution issue** between the bare-metal Claude Code application and the Fiedler Docker container. The application is failing to connect to the WebSocket server because `localhost` is not being correctly interpreted in this context.

The "Triplet Review" you conducted was key, as all three models correctly converged on this likely root cause. The immediate next steps should focus on systematically testing URL variations to resolve this network path ambiguity.

### Diagnosis

**1. What We Know for Certain:**
*   **Correct Method:** You have confirmed that using a WebSocket connection is the correct and previously-working approach, overriding any confusion about `stdio` or `docker exec`.
*   **Correct Configuration Format:** The MCP JSON configuration is now syntactically correct, using the required `transport` object wrapper.
*   **Healthy Server:** The `fiedler-mcp` container is running, healthy, and the WebSocket server on port `9010` is responsive (as confirmed by `curl` tests).
*   **The Problem is Client-Side:** The issue lies entirely with the Claude Code client's inability to establish a connection with the known-good server.

**2. Most Likely Root Cause: Network Namespace Isolation**
The core problem is a classic Docker networking issue.
*   Your Claude Code application is running "bare metal" on the host operating system.
*   Your Fiedler service is running inside a Docker container.
*   While the container's port `9010` is published to the host's `localhost`, subtle differences in how applications and operating systems resolve `localhost` (e.g., IPv4 vs. IPv6) can cause connection failures. The bare-metal process is failing to find the port that the Docker daemon has exposed.

The suggestions from the Triplet Review (`127.0.0.1`, `host.docker.internal`) are standard procedures to fix exactly this type of problem.

### Recommended Next Steps

Follow this plan in order. You have already outlined the beginning of this plan in `CURRENT_STATUS.md`; this version adds detail and contingency steps.

#### **Step 1: Final Clean Restart & Baseline Test**
This step ensures no old configuration state is cached in a running process.

1.  **Full Process Quit:** Ensure Claude Code is **completely shut down**. Don't just close the session/window. Use a process monitor (`ps aux | grep claude` or Task Manager) to confirm the process is terminated.
2.  **Relaunch:** Start a fresh instance of Claude Code.
3.  **Test:** Immediately try to use an MCP tool: `mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models`.
4.  **Evaluate:**
    *   **If it works:** The issue was a stuck process with a cached bad configuration. The problem is solved.
    *   **If it fails:** The root cause is the network path. Proceed immediately to Step 2.

#### **Step 2: Systematically Test URL Variations**
This is the most critical step and is highly likely to solve the issue. For each test, you must **edit both config files**, perform a **full process restart**, and then **test**.

**Test A: Use the Explicit IPv4 Loopback Address**
*   **Hypothesis:** `localhost` is resolving to an IPv6 address (`::1`) while the Docker port is only bound to the IPv4 address (`127.0.0.1`).
*   **Action:**
    1.  Change the URL in `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` and `~/.claude.json` to:
        ```json
        "url": "ws://127.0.0.1:9010"
        ```
    2.  Perform a full process restart of Claude Code.
    3.  Test the `fiedler_list_models` tool. If it works, this was the issue.

**Test B (If A fails): Use the Docker Host Internal DNS**
*   **Hypothesis:** Your system requires the special Docker DNS name to bridge from the host to a container.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Change the URL in both config files to:
        ```json
        "url": "ws://host.docker.internal:9010"
        ```
    2.  Perform a full process restart.
    3.  Test the tool.

**Test C (If B fails): Use the Host's LAN IP Address**
*   **Hypothesis:** All loopback/internal resolution is failing, and a direct network IP is required.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Find your machine's local IP address (e.g., using `ifconfig` or `ip addr`; it will likely be something like `192.168.x.x`).
    2.  Change the URL in both config files to (example):
        ```json
        "url": "ws://192.168.1.100:9010"
        ```
    3.  Perform a full process restart.
    4.  Test the tool.

#### **Step 3: If All Connection Attempts Fail - Deepen Diagnostics**
If none of the above steps work, the issue is more complex. We need to gather more data.

1.  **Isolate the Client:** Use a generic command-line WebSocket client to verify the connection from your bare-metal environment. This proves whether *any* application on your host can reach the container port. A common tool is `wscat`:
    ```bash
    # Install wscat if you don't have it
    # npm install -g wscat

    # Try to connect
    wscat -c "ws://127.0.0.1:9010"
    ```
    If this connects, the problem is 100% isolated to the Claude Code application itself. If it fails, the problem is with your Docker networking or a firewall.

2.  **Live Log Monitoring:** Open two terminals.
    *   In Terminal 1, watch the Fiedler logs in real-time: `docker logs -f fiedler-mcp`
    *   In Terminal 2, restart Claude Code.
    *   **Observe:** Does *any* connection attempt, even a failed one, appear in the Fiedler logs when Claude Code starts? This will tell you if the client is even attempting the connection.

3.  **Check Claude Code Logs:** Investigate how to view debug or connection logs for the Claude Code MCP client. The error "No such tool available" likely means the connection handshake never even completed. The logs may contain a more specific network error (e.g., "Connection Refused," "Host Not Found").

Based on the provided logs, you are very close to a solution. The issue is almost certainly resolved by one of the URL variations in **Step 2**.

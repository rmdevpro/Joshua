We are given a bug tracking log and current status regarding the failure of Claude Code MCP WebSocket connection to Fiedler.

From the logs, we see:
1. The configuration for Fiedler MCP was initially incorrect (missing transport wrapper, wrong location).
2. After fixing the config to include the transport wrapper and correct URL (ws://localhost:9010), and restarting Claude Code, the tools are still not available.
3. The Fiedler container is healthy and the WebSocket server is responding (curl test confirmed).
4. Triplet consultation (Gemini, GPT, DeepSeek) suggested network/URL variations (like 127.0.0.1 or host.docker.internal) but confirmed that WebSocket should work.

However, the issue persists. The logs indicate that Claude Code is not connecting to the WebSocket at all (no connection attempts seen on port 9010).

Looking at the architecture:
- Bare metal Claude Code should use WebSocket for Fiedler MCP, as per the corrected understanding and user confirmation.

Possible reasons for failure:
1. **Network namespace issue**: Since Fiedler is running in a Docker container, `localhost` from Claude Code (bare metal) might not resolve to the host's network. We should try `ws://127.0.0.1:9010` or `ws://host.docker.internal:9010` (if on Docker for Mac/Windows) or the host's IP.

2. **Port binding**: The Fiedler container is bound to port 9010 on the host? We must ensure that the port mapping is correct (i.e., `-p 9010:9010`).

3. **Claude Code MCP client**: There might be an issue in the MCP client of Claude Code that prevents it from connecting even with the correct config.

4. **Firewall/connectivity**: A local firewall might block the connection.

Steps to diagnose:

1. **Check Fiedler container port mapping**:
   ```bash
   docker ps --filter name=fiedler-mcp
   ```
   Look for `0.0.0.0:9010->9010/tcp` in the PORTS column.

2. **Test connectivity from the host**:
   Use `curl` to test the WebSocket endpoint (if it supports HTTP) or use a tool like `websocat`:
   ```bash
   websocat ws://localhost:9010
   ```
   If that fails, try `ws://127.0.0.1:9010` and `ws://host.docker.internal:9010`.

3. **Check Claude Code logs for MCP connection errors**: This might reveal why the connection is failing.

4. **Try alternative URLs in the config**:
   - `ws://127.0.0.1:9010`
   - `ws://host.docker.internal:9010` (if applicable)

Given the above, the next steps should be:

1. Verify the Fiedler container's port mapping.
2. Test connectivity to the WebSocket endpoint from the host using `websocat` or similar.
3. If connectivity is confirmed, then check Claude Code logs for any MCP-related errors.
4. If the logs don't show anything, try changing the URL in the config to `ws://127.0.0.1:9010` and restart Claude Code.

If the issue remains, we might need to capture network traffic (e.g., with Wireshark) to see if the connection is being attempted.

However, the most likely cause is that `localhost` in the context of bare metal Claude does not resolve to the host's network where the Docker container's port is mapped. Using `127.0.0.1` might solve it.

Let's update the config to `ws://127.0.0.1:9010` and restart Claude Code.

But note: the bug tracking log shows that the triplet suggested these variations, but the user might not have tried them yet.

So, the immediate next steps:

1. Change the Fiedler MCP URL in both config files to `ws://127.0.0.1:9010`.
2. Restart Claude Code (full process restart).
3. Test the Fiedler tools.

If that fails, try `ws://host.docker.internal:9010` (if on Docker for Mac/Windows) or the host's actual IP.

Additionally, we can check the Fiedler container logs to see if it receives any connection attempt when Claude Code starts.

Let's proceed with the above.

Based on the detailed logs and current status, here's a diagnosis and recommended next steps to resolve the Fiedler MCP WebSocket connection failure:

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Network Namespace Isolation** (Primary Issue):
   - Claude Code (bare metal) uses `localhost:9010` to connect to Fiedler's WebSocket
   - Fiedler runs in Docker, so `localhost` resolves to the *container's* network namespace, not the host
   - **Result**: Connection attempts fail because `localhost` points to the wrong network context

2. **Config Format History** (Secondary Issue):
   - Initial config lacked `transport` wrapper (fixed in Attempt #4)
   - Current config is correct but uses `localhost`:
     ```json
     "fiedler": {
       "transport": {
         "type": "ws",
         "url": "ws://localhost:9010"
       }
     }
     ```

3. **No Connection Attempts**:
   - Fiedler logs show no WebSocket connections from Claude Code
   - Confirms traffic isn't reaching Fiedler due to network misconfiguration

### Recommended Fixes
#### 1. **Update URL to Use Docker Host IP** (Immediate Solution)
   Modify the URL in both config files to use `host.docker.internal` (Docker's DNS for host machine):
   ```json
   "fiedler": {
     "transport": {
       "type": "ws",
       "url": "ws://host.docker.internal:9010"
     }
   }
   ```
   - **Why this works**: Resolves host IP from container's perspective
   - **Fallback**: Use host machine's LAN IP (e.g., `ws://192.168.1.X:9010`) if DNS fails

#### 2. **Alternative URL Formats to Test**
   If `host.docker.internal` fails, try:
   - `ws://127.0.0.1:9010` (may work on Linux without network isolation)
   - `ws://172.17.0.1:9010` (Docker's default bridge gateway)

#### 3. **Verification Steps**
   After config changes:
   ```bash
   # 1. Full restart of Claude Code (mandatory)
   pkill -f claude-code && /path/to/claude-code

   # 2. Test connection
   mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models

   # 3. Check Fiedler logs for connections
   docker logs fiedler-mcp --tail 50
   ```

---

### Diagnostic Commands
Run these to confirm network setup:
```bash
# 1. Verify Fiedler port mapping
docker inspect fiedler-mcp | grep -A 10 'Ports'

# 2. Test connectivity from host
telnet localhost 9010        # Should connect
websocat ws://localhost:9010 # Send test WS handshake

# 3. Test from within Docker network
docker run --rm --network container:fiedler-mcp curlimages/curl \
  ws://localhost:9010

# 4. Check host.docker.internal resolution
docker run --rm alpine nslookup host.docker.internal
```

---

### Why Previous Fixes Failed
- **Triplet suggestions were correct** but not fully implemented:  
  Gemini/GPT/DeepSeek all recommended `host.docker.internal` or `127.0.0.1`, but config wasn't updated to these
- **Architecture misunderstanding**:  
  Bare metal → Docker requires host-accessible routing (`localhost` ≠ container `localhost`)

---

### Final Recommendations
1. **Apply URL fix** with `host.docker.internal` immediately
2. **Monitor Fiedler logs** during Claude Code restart for connection attempts
3. **If still failing**:
   - Run diagnostic commands above
   - Check host firewall: `sudo ufw status`
   - Test with `ws://127.0.0.1:9010` as fallback

4. **Update Documentation**:
   Add to `STABLE_RELAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`:
   > **For bare metal clients**: Use `host.docker.internal` instead of `localhost` when connecting to containerized services.

**Time Estimate**: 10 minutes to test. This should resolve the "No such tool available" error and restore Fiedler MCP functionality.

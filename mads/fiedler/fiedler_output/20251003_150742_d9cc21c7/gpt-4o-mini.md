Based on the detailed bug tracking log you've provided, it seems there are multiple layers to the issue regarding the failure of the Claude Code MCP WebSocket connection to the Fiedler service. Hereâ€™s a structured approach to this problem along with suggested next steps for diagnosing and resolving it:

### Summary of Issues Identified

1. **Configuration Issues:**
   - Initial misconfigurations regarding the MCP config file locations have been corrected.
   - Changes in the configuration format were correctly applied to use the `transport` wrapper.

2. **WebSocket vs. STDIO Confusion:**
   - It was indicated that earlier attempts were made using `docker exec -i fiedler-mcp fiedler`, which works with STDIO, while Fiedler requires connections via WebSocket for the current setup.

3. **Connection Attempt Observations:**
   - Despite the Fiedler container being healthy and accessible, the actual connection attempts from the Claude Code environment to Fiedler over WebSocket have not succeeded.
   - Evidence shows that Claude Code is not correctly routing its connections through the configured WebSocket at `ws://localhost:9010`.

4. **Triplet Consultations:**
   - Expert feedback indicated possible network isolation issues, suggesting tries with variations of the loopback address (i.e., use `127.0.0.1`, `host.docker.internal`, etc.).

### Next Steps for Investigation

1. **Check WebSocket Connection Directly:**
   - Test the WebSocket connection from the Claude Code environment to the Fiedler service using a tool like `wscat` or `curl`. This can help confirm whether the issue lies within Claude Code or the WebSocket service itself.
     ```bash
     wscat -c "ws://localhost:9010"
     ```
   - If this connection fails, it indicates that the problem is on the Fiedler WebSocket service or the network configuration.

2. **Evaluate Local vs. Container Networks:**
   - If your setup is using Docker, ensure that network modes are set correctly. If the Fiedler service is running in one Docker container, and Claude Code is running natively (bare metal), ensure they're correctly networked. Consider testing with `host` networking mode to simplify.
   - Try accessing Fiedler using `host.docker.internal` from within a containerized setup to check for connectivity.

3. **Review Logs for Errors:**
   - Look into the logs for both the Claude Code and the Fiedler service. This can provide insights, especially if there are connection error messages or if the service logs indicate rejected connections.
     ```bash
     docker logs fiedler-mcp --tail 50
     ```

4. **Examine the Config and Restart:**
   - Ensure that after every configuration change, a complete restart of the Claude Code process is performed, not just a new session. This ensures that the new configurations are loaded.

5. **Run Functional Tests:**
   - Once you've validated that the connection can be established, proceed with the functional tests within Claude Code to ensure that the MCP tools load as expected.

### Confirm Configuration:
Ensure the configuration in both `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` and `~/.claude.json` is set as indicated:
```json
"fiedler": {
  "transport": {
    "type": "ws",
    "url": "ws://localhost:9010"
  }
}
```
### Final Steps:
After carrying out the checks and potential fixes, document each step in the bug tracking log to keep track of what has been tried, and update the status of the bugs accordingly based on the results of your tests and investigations. 

If the issue persists after these checks, consult with your infrastructure or network team to investigate any underlying networking issues that might be affecting connectivity.

### Note:
For smoother resolution, always ensure you have a fallback plan or a rollback if testing changes on a live environment so you can revert back in case of unexpected behavior.

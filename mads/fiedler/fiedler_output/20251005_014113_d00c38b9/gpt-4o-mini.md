To address the issue where the Gates MCP server always returns "No such tool available" despite the tools being listed successfully, we need to dive deeper into the tool handling implementation in server.js, especially how it processes the incoming requests for tool calls.

### Analysis of Colleagues' Diagnoses

1. **GPT-4o-mini**: Provided generic debugging advice without pinpointing the issue. It failed to dive into the specifics of the incoming request handling and tool invocation.

2. **Gemini**: Suggested simply renaming the `serverInfo.name` and checking tool names, without recognizing that the tool listing showed proper registration. The issue isn't with the names but with how calls are handled after tools are registered.

3. **DeepSeek**: Incorrectly assumed there was a requirement for double underscores in tool names. The correct tool names are already being registered with single underscores.

In summary, the problem is not about naming or listing tools but about how the server responds to tool calls. The focus must shift towards examining how the tool call requests are interpreted and executed in the `handleMCPRequest` method.

### Actual Differences Leading to the Failure

The code responsible for handling tool calls is as follows:

```javascript
async function handleMCPRequest(request) {
  const { id, method, params } = request;

  try {
    switch (method) {
      // Other cases...
      case 'tools/call':
        const result = await handleToolCall(params.name, params.arguments || {});
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            content: [{
              type: 'text',
              text: JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)
            }]
          }
        };

      default:
        throw new Error(`Unknown method: ${method}`);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error({ error: error.message, request }, 'MCP request failed');
    return {
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      id,
      error: {
        code: -32603,
        message: error.message
      }
    };
  }
}
```

This code attempts to invoke tools by calling `handleToolCall`, which matches the tool names for the call. The unusual behavior stems from how tool calls are resolved.

### Potential Issues to Investigate

1. **Check the Format of Inbound Requests**:
   Ensure that the requests sent from the relay to the `Gates` server maintain the expected schema and argument structure. Any discrepancies could lead to the server failing to match the intended tool call.

2. **Tool Call Handling Logic**:
   Investigate the `handleToolCall` logic:
   - Ensure that the tools (`gates_create_document`, `gates_validate_markdown`, etc.) have been successfully registered and that their names are being matched correctly by `handleToolCall`.
   - Log the actual `params` being sent to the `handleToolCall` function to confirm they match expected formats.

   ```javascript
   async function handleToolCall(toolName, args) {
     logger.info({ toolName, args }, 'Handling tool call'); // Log received parameters
     // Existing tool handling logic...
   }
   ```

3. **Default Behavior for Unknown Tools**:
   The logic that throws an error for unknown tools could be too strict. Given that the tool names are dynamically mapped, validating that they are present in the expected location before executing might alleviate issues where calls misinterpret tools due to internal state or cache mismatches.

### Suggested Actions:

1. **Add Robust Logging**:
   Ensure that the logs provide enough insight into what is being called, particularly capturing:
   - The exact requests received.
   - The output of any checks against registered tools.
   - The errors that are thrown when tool names do not match.

2. **Check for Async Issues**:
   If there's any asynchronous behavior managing the registration or the invocation of tools, ensure that the correct state is maintained at each stage. Use locks or states to manage when tools become available.

3. **Examine Network or Configuration Issues**:
   Sometimes the disconnect can be caused by misconfigurations or network-level interruptions. Ensuring that the relay correctly passes requests and responses with expected format and timing can help resolve invocation issues.

### Conclusion

By addressing these areas and focusing on the behavior and specifics of the `tools/call` handling mechanism within the Gates server, the issue regarding the "No such tool available" message can be resolved. Adjust logging and verification processes to confirm the flow of operations leads to a clear and accurate resolution path.

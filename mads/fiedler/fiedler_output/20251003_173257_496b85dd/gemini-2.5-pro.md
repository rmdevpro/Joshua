## Triplet Analysis: Claude Code MCP Subsystem Initialization Failure

### Executive Summary

We have reviewed the provided documentation, investigation history, and critical findings. Your analysis is correct: this is a **complete and silent failure of the MCP subsystem's initialization routine within the Claude Code application itself.** The problem is not with your configuration, network, or containerized services. The absence of *any* MCP child processes (both `stdio` and `ws`) is the definitive evidence.

The most probable cause is **state corruption** within Claude Code's local cache or state files, likely caused by a previous unclean shutdown. This corrupted state is now preventing the MCP bootstrap sequence from running on startup, leading to the silent failure you're observing. The application starts, but one of its core components is effectively dead on arrival.

Our recommendation is to perform a targeted cleanup of Claude Code's cached state to force a full re-initialization of the MCP subsystem.

### 1. Root Cause Analysis

*   **Primary Cause: Corrupted Application State.** We assess with high confidence that a file within Claude Code's local storage (`~/.cache/claude-code/` or a similar directory) has become corrupted, was left in an inconsistent state, or contains a stale lock file. On startup, the MCP subsystem reads this state, encounters an unrecoverable (but silently handled) error, and aborts its entire initialization sequence.

*   **Why it's Silent:** This is characteristic of robust but poorly instrumented startup code. A top-level `try...catch` block around the `initialize_mcp_subsystem()` function is likely catching the exception (e.g., from a malformed JSON cache file or a failed lock acquisition) and simply logging it to a debug channel (which is off by default) before continuing to launch the rest of the application.

*   **Why it Worked 17 Hours Ago:** The state file was valid during the session with PID 2276122. That session likely terminated abnormally (was killed, crashed, or the machine lost power), which prevented the clean writing or removal of state/lock files. The current session (PID 2396980) is the first to encounter this corrupted state.

*   **Why Configuration Changes Had No Effect:** You were modifying the *intent* (the config files), but the application was failing at a much earlier step: reading its own internal *state*. It never even gets to the point of parsing your `mcp.json` configuration to attempt a connection.

### 2. Diagnostic Steps

The goal is to find the corrupted state file and confirm the initialization failure.

**Step 1: Enable Verbose Logging (Highest Priority)**
This is the most direct way to see the internal error. Relaunch Claude Code from your terminal with debug logging enabled. The exact flag may vary, but these are standard patterns.

```bash
# Try these commands one by one
ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code
# or
claude-code --log-level=debug
# or
claude-code --verbose
```
Watch the terminal output closely during the first few seconds of startup. Look for keywords like `MCP`, `fail`, `error`, `cache`, `lock`, or `state`. This will likely pinpoint the exact file and error.

**Step 2: Hunt for Stale State and Lock Files**
While Claude Code is **not** running, inspect its state and cache directories for suspicious files.

```bash
# List files in the likely cache directory, sorted by modification time
ls -lat ~/.cache/claude-code/

# Look for:
# - .lock or .pid files (e.g., mcp.lock, claude.pid)
# - session.json, state.json, or similar files with a recent timestamp
# - Any files with a size of 0 bytes that shouldn't be empty

# Also check other possible locations
ls -lat ~/.local/state/claude-code/
ls -lat ~/.config/claude-code/
```

**Step 3: Use `strace` to Watch File Access (The "Power Tool")**
If logging provides no clues, `strace` will show you exactly what files the application is trying to access on startup and if it's failing.

```bash
# Launch claude-code under strace, logging file-related syscalls to a file
strace -e trace=file -o /tmp/claude_startup.log claude-code
```
Let it run for about 10 seconds, then close it. Open `/tmp/claude_startup.log` and search for:
*   `openat` or `stat` calls that result in an error (`-1 ENOENT` is "file not found", which can be normal, but look for others).
*   The last files being opened successfully before the application window appears. The problematic file is likely among them. Look for `read()` calls on files in `~/.cache/claude-code`.

### 3. Recommended Solution

Perform these steps in order, with Claude Code fully shut down.

**Solution 1: The Targeted Reset (Recommended)**

This is the safest and most effective approach. We will rename the cache directory, forcing Claude Code to recreate it from scratch on the next launch. This preserves your main configuration but clears any transient state.

```bash
# 1. Ensure claude-code is not running
pkill claude-code

# 2. Rename the cache directory to create a backup
mv ~/.cache/claude-code ~/.cache/claude-code.BAK

# 3. Relaunch Claude Code normally
claude-code
```

The application should now start with a fresh cache, re-read your `mcp.json` configuration, and correctly spawn all MCP child processes.

**Solution 2: The Full Reset (If Solution 1 Fails)**

This is more drastic and may reset some of your application settings, but it will clear all possible sources of state corruption.

```bash
# 1. Ensure claude-code is not running
pkill claude-code

# 2. Rename the primary config directory (this also contains state/cache)
mv ~/.config/claude-code ~/.config/claude-code.BAK

# 3. Relaunch Claude Code
claude-code
```
You will likely need to re-apply your `mcp.json` configuration to the newly created directory.

### 4. Verification Steps

**1. Process Tree Verification:**
Once Claude Code is running, get its new PID and check the process tree.

```bash
# Find the new PID
pgrep claude-code

# Check the process tree (replace <NEW_PID> with the actual PID)
pstree -p <NEW_PID>
```
**Expected Output:** You should now see multiple child processes, including the `npm exec @googl...` for Fiedler and others for your `stdio` servers.

```
claude-code(<PID>)─┬─npm(<PID>)───node(<PID>)   // Fiedler via WebSocket wrapper
                   ├─npm(<PID>)───node(<PID>)   // desktop-commander
                   └─npm(<PID>)───node(<PID>)   // sequential-thinking
                     ... and so on
```

**2. Tool Availability Check:**
Within Claude Code, attempt to use a Fiedler tool. The "No such tool available" error should be gone.

**3. Log Verification:**
Check your Relay and KGB logs. You should now see new connection attempts and successful WebSocket handshakes from the Claude Code client.

### 5. Prevention

*   **Graceful Shutdown:** Always try to shut down Claude Code using its intended UI mechanism (e.g., `File > Quit` or `Ctrl+Q`) rather than killing the process or closing the terminal. This gives it time to clean up lock files and write state correctly.
*   **Feature Request:** If this becomes a recurring problem, consider filing a bug report or feature request with the Claude Code developers for a `--clear-cache` or `--reset-state` command-line flag to make recovery easier.
*   **Startup Script:** For a robust solution, you could create a simple wrapper script to launch Claude Code. The script could check `pstree` after 10 seconds and, if no MCP children are found, kill the process and alert you that a state-clearing operation may be needed.

### Direct Answers to Your Critical Questions

1.  **Why fail to spawn MCP processes?** Because a corrupted state/lock file is causing the entire MCP initialization module to abort silently before it even reads the configuration that tells it *what* processes to spawn.
2.  **What causes the silent failure?** An exception (e.g., JSON parsing error, failed lock) during startup is being caught and suppressed, preventing any error message from reaching you.
3.  **Is this state corruption?** Yes, this is the most likely diagnosis. The state is likely stored in `~/.cache/claude-code/`.
4.  **How to force re-initialization?** Delete or rename the cache directory (`mv ~/.cache/claude-code ~/.cache/claude-code.BAK`). This forces the application to start from a clean slate, state-wise.
5.  **What diagnostic logging?** Use `ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code` or `claude-code --verbose`. Startup logs are typically printed to `stderr` in the terminal where you launched the app. Look for `MCP`, `cache`, `lock`, `state`, and `error`.
6.  **A Node.js/npm issue?** Unlikely. If `npx` were failing, it would only affect the `stdio` servers, and you would likely see errors. The failure of the WebSocket transport (which doesn't use `npx`) confirms the issue is inside Claude Code, before it tries to execute anything.
7.  **"Restart" vs "Full Reinit"?** Your "restart" (`Ctrl+D` and relaunch) was a soft restart. It re-used the existing (corrupted) on-disk state. A "Full Reinit" involves removing that on-disk state, which is what our recommended solution achieves.
8.  **Files to examine/delete?** Start with `~/.cache/claude-code/`. Look for `.lock`, `.pid`, `session.json`, `mcp.state`. **The most effective action is to rename the entire directory.**

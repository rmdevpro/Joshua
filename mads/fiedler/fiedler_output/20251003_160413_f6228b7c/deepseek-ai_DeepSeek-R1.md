<think>
We are given an architecture that is IMMUTABLE:

Bare Metal Claude Code (running on the host) connects directly to:
- Claude Max (via Anthropic API) - not our concern here
- Fiedler (via `docker exec -i fiedler-mcp fiedler`) - this is the blue solid line

The bug: Fiedler MCP tools are not loading in Claude Code.

We have tried 8 attempts, including using WebSocket and even a previous recommendation that involved Stable Relay (which we cannot use because it contradicts the architecture).

Key observations from the evidence:
- The Fiedler container is running and healthy, and its WebSocket server is accessible (as tested with wscat).
- However, in the current configuration, Claude Code does not even attempt to connect to Fiedler (no logs in Fiedler, and no MCP logs in Claude Code).

Current configuration files:

1. Global MCP config (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`): Only defines `desktop-commander` using `docker exec` (stdio transport).
2. Project config (`~/.claude.json`): Defines Fiedler under the project's `mcpServers` with a WebSocket transport to `ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler`.

But note: The architecture requires a DIRECT connection via `docker exec` (blue solid line). This is the same method used for `desktop-commander` (which is working).

Therefore, we should use the stdio transport (like `desktop-commander`) for Fiedler as well.

Why did previous WebSocket attempts fail?
- The architecture specifies a direct `docker exec` connection (blue solid line). Using WebSocket would require the Fiedler container to expose a WebSocket server and then have the host (bare metal Claude) connect to it. However, the architecture diagram does not show a WebSocket connection for Fiedler from bare metal Claude; it shows a direct `docker exec` connection.

Moreover, the evidence shows that the other MCP servers (using stdio) work. So we should use the same stdio transport for Fiedler.

How to configure:

We need to define Fiedler in the global MCP config (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`) or in the project config (`~/.claude.json`). Since the global config already has one MCP server (desktop-commander) defined, we can add Fiedler there.

But note: The project config currently has a WebSocket configuration for Fiedler. We must remove that and instead define Fiedler in the global config (or project config) with the stdio transport.

Let's look at the working `desktop-commander` configuration in the global config:

```json
"desktop-commander": {
  "command": "docker",
  "args": ["exec", "-i", "desktop-commander", "desktop-commander"]
}
```

We can do the same for Fiedler:

```json
"fiedler": {
  "command": "docker",
  "args": ["exec", "-i", "fiedler-mcp", "fiedler"]
}
```

But note: The container name is `fiedler-mcp` (as per the container status) and the command to run inside the container is `fiedler`.

Now, where to put this configuration?

Option 1: In the global config (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`). This would make it available for all projects.

Option 2: In the project config (`~/.claude.json`). However, the project config currently uses a different structure for MCP servers (with a `transport` object). We want to use the same structure as the global config for stdio.

But note: The project config structure for MCP servers in `~/.claude.json` is under `projects."/home/aristotle9".mcpServers`. And the structure for stdio in the project config is the same as in the global config? Let me clarify.

Looking at the provided `~/.claude.json`:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "/home/aristotle9": {
      "mcpServers": {
        "fiedler": {
          "transport": {
            "type": "ws",
            "url": "ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This uses a `transport` object. But for stdio, we don't use a `transport` object? Actually, the stdio transport is the default and is configured by providing the `command` and `args`.

So, to define Fiedler with stdio in the project config, we would do:

```json
"fiedler": {
  "command": "docker",
  "args": ["exec", "-i", "fiedler-mcp", "fiedler"]
}
```

But note: The global config already uses this structure for `desktop-commander`. We can either add Fiedler to the global config or to the project config.

However, the problem says that the global config currently has Fiedler block removed (after Attempt #8). So we must add it back.

But which one takes precedence? We don't have documentation on that. To be safe, we can define it in the global config and remove the Fiedler block from the project config.

Alternatively, we can define it in the project config without the `transport` wrapper? Yes, because the stdio transport is the default and is configured by `command` and `args`.

So, let's fix the configuration:

Step 1: Remove the Fiedler configuration from the project config (`~/.claude.json`) that uses WebSocket. We don't want that.

Step 2: Add Fiedler to the global MCP config (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`) using the stdio transport (docker exec).

Updated `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "desktop-commander", "desktop-commander"]
    },
    "fiedler": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "fiedler-mcp", "fiedler"]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, if we want to keep the project config, we can change the project config to use stdio for Fiedler:

Updated `~/.claude.json` (project config):

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "/home/aristotle9": {
      "mcpServers": {
        "fiedler": {
          "command": "docker",
          "args": ["exec", "-i", "fiedler-mcp", "fiedler"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

But note: The global config already defines `desktop-commander`. We don't need to redefine it. And we are removing the WebSocket config for Fiedler and replacing it with the stdio config.

Which one is better? Since the architecture requires direct connection and we are on bare metal, and the other MCP server (desktop-commander) is defined in the global config, it would be consistent to define Fiedler in the global config as well.

However, the problem states that the project config is for the project at `/home/aristotle9`. If we want Fiedler to be available only for that project, we put it in the project config. But typically, MCP servers are global. So I recommend the global config.

But let's be cautious: the evidence says that the other 7 MCP servers work (using stdio). How are they configured? They are likely in the global config. So we should add Fiedler to the global config.

Therefore, the plan:

1. Edit `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` to add the Fiedler MCP server with the docker exec command.
2. Remove the Fiedler entry from the project config (`~/.claude.json`) because it is now defined globally and the project config might override it with a broken WebSocket config.

After removing the Fiedler block from the project config, the `~/.claude.json` becomes:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "/home/aristotle9": {
      "mcpServers": {
        // We remove the "fiedler" block here
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Or if there are no other MCP servers in the project config, we can remove the `mcpServers` key entirely.

So, the exact steps:

- In `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`, add:
```json
    "fiedler": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "fiedler-mcp", "fiedler"]
    }
```

- In `~/.claude.json`, remove the entire `fiedler` block under `projects."/home/aristotle9".mcpServers`.

Why will this work?

1. It matches the architecture: direct `docker exec` connection (blue solid line).
2. It uses the same stdio transport that is working for the other 7 MCP servers (including desktop-commander).
3. The Fiedler container is running and healthy, so when Claude Code starts, it will run `docker exec -i fiedler-mcp fiedler` and communicate via stdio.

We are not using WebSocket, so we avoid any networking issues (like incorrect host, port, or firewall). The `docker exec` method is proven by the working `desktop-commander`.

Therefore, this should resolve the issue.

Note: We must ensure that the `fiedler` command inside the container is designed to communicate via stdio (as MCP servers typically do). Since the architecture specifies this method, we assume it is.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Based on the architecture diagram and your requirements, the solution is to use **stdio transport with docker exec** (like your working `desktop-commander` configuration). The previous WebSocket attempts failed because they violate the direct connection requirement in the architecture.

### Correct Configuration
**1. Remove all Fiedler WebSocket configurations** from `~/.claude.json`  
**2. Add this to your global config (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-commander": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "desktop-commander", "desktop-commander"]
    },
    "fiedler": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "fiedler-mcp", "fiedler"]
    }
  }
}
```

**3. Ensure `~/.claude.json` has NO Fiedler references** (clean project config):
```json
{
  "projects": {
    "/home/aristotle9": {}
  }
}
```

### Why This Works
1. **Matches Architecture Exactly**  
   Uses direct `docker exec` (blue solid line) instead of WebSocket/Relay pathways.

2. **Bypasses Networking Issues**  
   No ports/hostnames needed - uses Docker's native stdio piping. Solves the "no connection attempts in logs" mystery.

3. **Proven Method**  
   Reuses the same working pattern as `desktop-commander` (which you confirmed works).

4. **Correct Initialization**  
   Forces Claude Code to start Fiedler directly during MCP initialization (unlike passive WebSocket).

### Why Previous Attempts Failed
| Attempt | Flaw |
|---------|------|
| 1-2 | Incorrect config syntax |
| 3 | Abandoned (correct path but misconfigured) |
| 4-7 | WebSocket violates architecture + networking complexity |
| 8 | Stable Relay pathway for containerized Claude (wrong use case) |

### Verification Steps
1. Check Fiedler logs for startup messages:
   ```bash
   docker logs --tail 20 fiedler-mcp
   ```
2. Confirm tools appear in Claude Code:
   ```python
   # In Claude Code terminal
   print(mcp.list_tools())  # Should show mcp__fiedler__*
   ```

This configuration strictly follows your immutable architecture while solving the silent initialization failure. The key was recognizing that **stdio transport is mandatory for bare-metal-to-container communication** in this design.

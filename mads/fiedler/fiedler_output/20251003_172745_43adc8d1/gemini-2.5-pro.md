Excellent and thorough analysis. The discovery of the missing child processes via process tree analysis is the critical breakthrough. You have correctly identified that this is a fundamental initialization failure of the MCP subsystem itself, not a configuration or network issue for a specific server.

Based on your detailed report, here is a complete analysis and a set of actionable steps to resolve the issue.

---

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

The evidence overwhelmingly points to a **corrupted state or cache within the Claude Code application environment** that is causing the entire MCP subsystem to silently fail during its initialization sequence.

*   **Primary Cause:** A stale lock file, corrupted cache, or invalid state file is likely being read by Claude Code on startup. This file is causing the MCP initialization logic to either crash internally (without bubbling up a user-facing error) or to exit prematurely, believing its job is already done or that it's in an invalid state. This completely prevents it from ever reaching the stage where it would spawn child processes (`npx`, `python`, etc.) for either stdio or WebSocket-based MCP servers.

*   **Why It Worked 17 Hours Ago:** The state was clean in the previous session (PID 2276122). An event between that session's termination and the current session's startup (e.g., an improper shutdown, a system crash, a background process interfering) likely created the corrupted state file.

*   **Why It's Silent:** This is characteristic of "defensive" startup code that encounters an unexpected state. Instead of crashing the whole application, the subsystem might just log a debug-level error (if that) and disable itself. Since you are not running with debug logging, the failure is invisible.

*   **Secondary (Less Likely) Cause:** A sudden change in the `npx`/`node` execution environment. If the `PATH` environment variable available to the Claude Code process (PID 2396980) is somehow different or broken compared to your interactive shell, it might not be able to find `npx`. However, this is less likely because it would not explain why the WebSocket servers also fail to initialize (as they don't necessarily require `npx` to start their connection logic). The common point of failure is the central MCP manager.

This is not a bug in your configuration, the network, or the Docker containers. It is an internal application state problem within Claude Code.

## 2. Diagnostic Steps

Let's proceed with a logical sequence of checks to pinpoint the exact cause before attempting a fix.

### Step 1: Enable Verbose Logging (Crucial First Step)

The previous triplet was correct; we need to see the internal logs.

1.  **Stop Claude Code completely.** Ensure no `claude-code` processes are running (`pkill claude-code`).
2.  **Relaunch with debug logging enabled.** Open a terminal and run:
    ```bash
    ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code --log-file=~/claude-startup.log
    ```
3.  **Let it run for 30 seconds, then close it.**
4.  **Inspect the log file.** Search for keywords related to the MCP subsystem's startup.
    ```bash
    grep -i -E "mcp|fiedler|spawn|child|init|state|lock|cache" ~/claude-startup.log
    ```
    Look for any error messages, warnings about "stale lock files," "failed to acquire lock," or "invalid cache version." This is our best chance to get a direct error message from the application.

### Step 2: Manually Test the `npx` Spawning Environment

Let's confirm that the `npx` commands themselves work, ruling out the secondary cause.

1.  In your terminal, run the exact command for one of the stdio MCP servers from your config:
    ```bash
    npx -y @executeautomation/desktop-commander-mcp
    ```
2.  **Expected Result:** The command should run and likely print some JSON to stdout, indicating it's an MCP server ready for communication. If it fails with a "command not found" or other Node.js error, you have an environment problem.

### Step 3: Inspect for Stale State and Lock Files

This is a manual check for the most likely culprits.

1.  **List potential state/cache directories:**
    ```bash
    # Primary cache location
    ls -la ~/.cache/claude-code/

    # Primary config location (check for .lock, .pid, or session files)
    ls -la ~/.config/claude-code/
    ```
2.  **Look for:**
    *   Any files with `.lock` or `.pid` extensions.
    *   Directories named `mcp_state`, `sessions`, or `ipc`.
    *   Any files with recent modification timestamps that are not your `mcp.json` config file.

## 3. Recommended Solution

Follow these steps in order. **Step 1 will likely solve the problem.**

### Step 1: Clear the Application Cache (The "Safe Reset")

This is the most common fix for this type of problem and is non-destructive to your configuration.

1.  **Ensure Claude Code is fully shut down.**
    ```bash
    pkill claude-code
    # Verify it's gone
    pgrep claude-code
    ```
2.  **Back up and remove the cache directory.**
    ```bash
    # Create a backup just in case
    mv ~/.cache/claude-code ~/.cache/claude-code.bak

    # You can also just delete it if you are confident
    # rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-code
    ```
3.  **Look for and remove any lock files in the config directory.**
    ```bash
    # Example command, adjust if you find a specific file
    find ~/.config/claude-code/ -name "*.lock" -exec rm -v {} \;
    ```
4.  **Relaunch Claude Code normally.** The application will be forced to regenerate its cache and state from scratch, which should re-initialize the MCP subsystem correctly.

### Step 2: Isolate and Rebuild Configuration (The "Forceful Reset")

Only perform this if Step 1 fails. This helps rule out subtle corruption in the JSON configuration files themselves (e.g., invisible characters).

1.  **Shut down Claude Code.**
2.  **Rename your primary configuration files:**
    ```bash
    mv ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json.bak
    mv ~/.claude.json ~/.claude.json.bak
    ```
3.  **Start Claude Code.** It will start in a "fresh" state. See if any default MCP tools load.
4.  **Shut it down again.**
5.  **Carefully restore your configuration.** Instead of moving the files back, copy the *contents* of your `.bak` files into the newly generated config files. This cleans out any potential file-level metadata corruption.
6.  **Restart Claude Code** and check if the MCP subsystem initializes.

## 4. Verification Steps

After applying the solution, here is how to confirm it worked:

1.  **Process Tree Analysis (The Definitive Check):**
    *   Get the new PID: `pgrep claude-code`
    *   Check the process tree: `pstree -p $(pgrep claude-code)`
    *   **Expected Output:** You should now see multiple child processes, including `npm exec...` for your stdio servers. This is the ultimate confirmation that the subsystem is alive.
    ```
    claude-code(2396980)─┬─npm(2401122)───node(2401135)
                         ├─npm(2401123)───node(2401136)
                         └─... (other claude threads)
    ```

2.  **Tool Availability Check:**
    *   Inside Claude Code, attempt to use an MCP tool like `mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models`.
    *   **Expected Result:** The tool should now be available and execute successfully.

3.  **Log Verification:**
    *   Check the logs of your `fiedler-mcp` and `stable-relay` containers.
    *   **Expected Result:** You should see new WebSocket connection attempts and successful handshakes in the logs, corresponding to when you launched the fixed Claude Code.

## 5. Prevention

1.  **Graceful Shutdown:** Always try to shut down Claude Code using its designated exit procedure (e.g., `Ctrl+D`, File > Quit) rather than killing the process, which can leave state files in an inconsistent state.
2.  **Health Check Feature:** Propose a feature for Claude Code: a command-line flag or internal command (`claude --mcp-status`) that explicitly checks the health of the MCP subsystem and reports which servers are loaded and their status. This would make diagnosing this issue trivial in the future.
3.  **Robust Initialization:** The Claude Code developers should consider making the MCP initialization more robust. On detecting a stale lock file or corrupted cache, it should automatically attempt to clean it or at least produce a loud, user-facing warning instead of failing silently.
4.  **Configuration Versioning:** Continue using Git to manage your configuration files. This was invaluable in proving the configuration itself had not changed.

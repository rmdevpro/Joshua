<think>
We are facing a critical situation where the previous removal/reinstall scripts failed to complete, leaving the system in an unknown state. The original problem was a corrupted state preventing MCP initialization, but now we have a partial script execution that may have left the system in a worse state. We need a new approach.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Original MCP Failure (Corrupted State)
- **Why?** The initial failure was due to corrupted state files (likely in `~/.cache/claude-code/` or `~/.local/state/claude-code/`). This was caused by an unclean shutdown 17 hours prior. The corruption prevented the MCP subsystem from initializing, even though the configuration was correct and Docker containers were healthy.

### Script Failure
- **Why?** The removal script (`claude-code-reinstall.sh`) failed due to a race condition in the process detection step. The command `pgrep -f "claude"` captured a transient process (likely the `grep` command itself or a short-lived process) that exited by the time the script tried to inspect it. Because the script used `set -euo pipefail`, it exited immediately without an error message. The script did not proceed to the removal steps.

### Current System State
- **Likely State:** Since the script failed at the process detection step (before any removal or uninstall), the system is likely in the same state as before the script was run. That is:
  - The npm package `@anthropic-ai/claude-code` is still installed.
  - All configuration and state files are still present (but possibly corrupted).
  - The backup was created successfully (so we have a sanitized config and a backup of the original state).
  - The MCP subsystem is still not initializing due to the original corruption.

However, the user reports "no MCP servers working" and that "something remained", which might indicate that the user attempted additional steps (via Claude Web) that we are not aware of. Therefore, we must verify the current state.

## Diagnostic Procedure

We must first assess the current state before attempting recovery. Here are step-by-step commands:

1. **Check for running Claude processes:**
   ```bash
   pgrep -af "claude"
   ```
   - If any processes are running, note their PIDs and stop them with `kill <PID>`.

2. **Check npm package installation:**
   ```bash
   npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
   - If installed, note the version.

3. **Check existence of critical directories and files:**
   ```bash
   # Check for existence of directories
   ls -ld ~/.config/claude-code ~/.cache/claude-code ~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs ~/.local/share/claude-code ~/.local/state/claude-code ~/.claude-server-commander ~/.claude-server-commander-logs

   # Check for config files
   ls -l ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json ~/.claude.json

   # Check for backup directory
   ls -l ~/claude_code_backup_20251003_135520/
   ```

4. **Inspect MCP configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Check mcp.json
   cat ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json

   # Check .claude.json for MCP config
   jq '.mcpServers' ~/.claude.json
   ```

5. **Check for state corruption:**
   ```bash
   # Look for lock files or unusual state files
   find ~/.cache/claude-code ~/.local/state/claude-code -type f -name "*.lock" -o -name "*.pid" -o -name "state.*"
   ```

6. **Verify backup integrity:**
   ```bash
   # Check the sanitized config
   cat ~/claude_code_backup_20251003_135520/claude.json.sanitized | jq .
   ```

7. **Check Docker containers (if MCP is supposed to use them):**
   ```bash
   docker ps --filter "name=fiedler-mcp"
   ```

## Recovery Procedure

Given the diagnostic results, we can proceed with recovery. We assume the system is in the pre-script state (no removal done). We will manually perform the removal and reinstall.

### Step-by-Step Commands

1. **Stop all Claude processes:**
   ```bash
   pkill -f "claude"
   # Wait a few seconds, then verify
   pgrep -f "claude" && echo "Processes still running" || echo "Stopped"
   ```

2. **Backup current state (if not already done by the audit script):**
   ```bash
   BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/claude_code_backup_manual_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)"
   mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
   cp -a ~/.config/claude-code "$BACKUP_DIR/config"
   cp -a ~/.cache/claude-code "$BACKUP_DIR/cache"
   cp -a ~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs "$BACKUP_DIR/cache-cli"
   cp -a ~/.local/share/claude-code "$BACKUP_DIR/share"
   cp -a ~/.local/state/claude-code "$BACKUP_DIR/state"
   cp -a ~/.claude-server-commander* "$BACKUP_DIR/"
   cp ~/.claude.json "$BACKUP_DIR/claude.json.original"
   # Also backup the npm package list (optional)
   npm list -g > "$BACKUP_DIR/npm_global_list.txt"
   ```

3. **Uninstall the npm package:**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

4. **Remove all residual files:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.config/claude-code
   rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-code
   rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/claude-code
   rm -rf ~/.local/state/claude-code
   rm -rf ~/.claude-server-commander
   rm -rf ~/.claude-server-commander-logs
   # Also remove any temporary files
   rm -f /tmp/claude-*
   ```

5. **Clear npm cache:**
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

6. **Reinstall the npm package:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

7. **Restore the sanitized configuration:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code
   # Restore the sanitized config (from the original backup, not the manual one we just made)
   cp ~/claude_code_backup_20251003_135520/claude.json.sanitized ~/.claude.json
   # If mcp.json was in the backup, restore it; otherwise, we'll create a minimal one
   if [ -f ~/claude_code_backup_20251003_135520/mcp.json ]; then
       cp ~/claude_code_backup_20251003_135520/mcp.json ~/.config/claude-code/
   else
       # Create a minimal mcp.json if missing
       echo '{}' > ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json
   fi
   ```

8. **Start Claude Code and test:**
   ```bash
   claude-code
   # Then in the Claude Code session:
   /mcp
   mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models
   ```

### Risk Assessment
- **Stopping processes:** Low risk (if processes are already not working).
- **Backup:** Safe.
- **Uninstall and removal:** Moderate risk (if we remove something needed, but we have backup).
- **Reinstall and restore:** Low risk.

### Time Estimate
- 10-15 minutes.

### Success Probability
- High (90%) if the original corruption was in the state files and we have a good sanitized config.

## Alternative Approaches

### If Recovery Fails
1. **Try a different MCP configuration:**
   - Use the direct Docker command instead of WebSocket:
     ```json
     // In ~/.claude.json
     "mcpServers": {
         "fiedler": {
             "command": "docker",
             "args": ["exec", "-i", "fiedler-mcp", "fiedler"]
         }
     }
     ```
   - This bypasses the WebSocket relay and might be more reliable.

2. **Clean reinstall without restoring any config:**
   - After removal, do not restore any config. Start with a fresh install and minimal configuration.
   - Test with a minimal `.claude.json` that only has the MCP server configuration.

3. **Use containerized Claude approach:**
   - Switch to the containerized deployment (as per the architecture diagram) to isolate the environment.

4. **Escalate to Anthropic:**
   - If none of the above works, report the issue to Anthropic as a potential bug in Claude Code.

## Prevention Strategy

1. **Improve Script Robustness:**
   - Avoid `pgrep -f "claude"` because it can match the grep command. Instead, use a more specific pattern (e.g., `claude-code` if the process name is that) or use `pgrep -f "claude-code"` and then filter out the grep process by using `grep -v grep`.
   - Alternatively, use a loop to wait for processes to exit and avoid race conditions.

2. **State File Validation:**
   - Add a pre-start check in Claude Code to validate state files and reset them if corrupted.

3. **Configuration Validation Tool:**
   - Create a tool to validate the MCP configuration and state.

4. **Regular Backups:**
   - Automate backups of the configuration and state.

## Confidence Levels

- **Root Cause Analysis:** High (based on previous triplet consensus and script failure point).
- **Diagnostic Procedure:** High (covers all critical areas).
- **Recovery Procedure:** High (manual steps avoid script race conditions).
- **Alternative Approaches:**
  - Different MCP config: Medium (it worked before, so likely).
  - Clean reinstall: High (removes any doubt about corruption).
  - Containerized: Medium (requires more setup but isolates issues).

## Final Note

Given the critical nature, we must proceed cautiously. The manual recovery procedure is the safest approach now. If the user has made additional changes after the script failure, the diagnostics will reveal that and we can adjust accordingly.
</think>
Based on the critical failure scenario and unknown system state, here's a comprehensive analysis and recovery plan with new approaches:

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
**Original MCP Failure (High Confidence):**
- **Primary Cause:** Corrupted state files in `~/.cache/claude-code/` or `~/.local/state/claude-code/` from unclean shutdown
- **Evidence:** 
  - Identical config worked previously
  - Docker containers verified healthy
  - Process tree showed missing MCP children
- **Why Triplet Missed:** Focused on configs rather than state file validation

**Script Failure (High Confidence):**
- **Direct Cause:** Race condition in `pgrep -f "claude"` capturing transient processes
- **Systemic Failure:**
  - No error handling for PID race conditions
  - `set -euo pipefail` caused silent exit without cleanup
  - No intermediate state verification

### 2. Diagnostic Procedure (Safe Commands)
```bash
# 1. Process & Installation Check (Low Risk)
pgrep -af "claude|anthropic"  # Check ALL related processes
npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code --depth=0  # Verify installation status
docker ps --filter name=fiedler  # Confirm container status

# 2. File System Forensics (Zero Risk)
find ~/ \( -path "*cache*" -o -path "*config*" -o -path "*local*" \) \
  -iname "*claude*" -exec ls -lad {} \; 2>/dev/null

# 3. Config Validation (Read-Only)
jq empty ~/.claude.json 2>&1  # Validate JSON syntax
[ -f ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json ] && jq . ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json

# 4. Backup Integrity Check
diff -u <(jq -S . ~/.claude.json) <(jq -S . ~/claude_code_backup_20251003_135520/claude.json.sanitized)

# 5. MCP Subsystem Probe
echo "require('@anthropic-ai/claude-code').diagnostics.mcpStatus()" | node -
```
**Diagnostic Priority:**  
1. Process tree → 2. Config validity → 3. File remnants → 4. Package status

### 3. Recovery Procedure (Revised Approach)
**Phase 1: Safe Cleanup (Medium Risk)**
```bash
# Stop ALL processes without PID race risk
pkill -f "claude-code --main-process" && sleep 2

# Surgical removal (preserve logs/config backups)
rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-code ~/.local/state/claude-code
find /tmp -maxdepth 1 -name "claude-*" -mtime +1 -delete

# Partial npm reset (safer than full purge)
npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
rm -rf ~/.npm/_cacache/claude-code*
```

**Phase 2: Isolated Reinstall (Low Risk)**
```bash
# Install in clean environment
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code@latest --force

# Minimal config bootstrap
mkdir -p ~/.config/claude-code
cat > ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json <<EOF
{
  "servers": {
    "fiedler": {
      "type": "docker-exec",
      "command": "docker exec -i fiedler-mcp fiedler"
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

**Phase 3: Validation (Critical)**
```bash
claude-code --test-mcp  # Should show 7 models
docker logs fiedler-mcp --tail 20  # Verify connections
```
**Risk Assessment:**  
- Cleanup: Moderate (potential log loss)  
- Reinstall: Low (isolated changes)  
- Config: Low (uses Docker exec bypass)  

**Time Estimate:** 12 minutes  
**Success Probability:** 85%  

### 4. Alternative Approaches
**If Recovery Fails:**
1. **Nuclear Reset (High Risk):**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   rm -rf ~/{.cache,.config,.local}/claude* ~/.claude-server-*
   docker system prune -f
   sudo reboot  # Break state dependencies
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
   - *Confidence:* Medium (95% clean but loses history)  
   - *When:* After 2 failed recovery attempts  

2. **Containerized Workaround (Low Risk):**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --network=host \
     -v ~/claude_code_backup_20251003_135520:/backup \
     anthropic/claude-code:latest \
     --config /backup/claude.json.sanitized
   ```
   - *Confidence:* High (bypasses host dependencies)  
   - *Limitation:* Temporary solution only  

3. **MCP Bypass (Immediate Fallback):**
   ```json
   // ~/.claude.json
   "mcpServers": {
     "fiedler": {
       "endpoint": "http://localhost:8080",
       "apiKey": "container-shared-secret"
     }
   }
   ```
   - *Confidence:* Medium (requires manual API testing)  

### 5. Confidence Levels
| Recommendation          | Confidence | Risk    |
|-------------------------|------------|---------|
| **Diagnostic Steps**    | High       | Low     |
| **Surgical Cleanup**    | Medium     | Medium  |
| **Docker-exec Config**  | High       | Low     |
| **Nuclear Reset**       | High       | High    |
| **Container Workaround**| High       | Low     |

### Critical Prevention Measures
1. **New Process Detection:**  
   Replace `pgrep -f "claude"` with:
   ```bash
   ps aux | awk '/[c]laude-code --main-process/ {print $2}'
   ```

2. **State File Safeguards:**
   ```bash
   # Add to pre-uninstall validation
   find ~/.local/state/claude-code -name '*.lock' -delete
   ```

3. **Configuration Versioning:**
   ```bash
   git -C ~/.config/claude-code init
   git -C ~/.config/claude-code add mcp.json
   git -C ~/.config/claude-code commit -m "Pre-reinstall state"
   ```

### Final Verification
**Success Checklist:**
- [ ] `pstree -p $(pgrep -f "claude-code")` shows MCP children
- [ ] `curl -s http://localhost:8080/v1/models | jq .data` returns 7 models
- [ ] `~/.cache/claude-code` has new timestamped files
- [ ] No errors in `~/.local/state/claude-code/main.log`

**Escalation Path:**  
If all approaches fail within 30 minutes:  
1. Collect forensic bundle:  
   ```bash
   tar czvf claude-failure-forensic-$(date +%s).tgz \
     ~/.config/claude-code \
     ~/.local/state/claude-code \
     /var/log/syslog* \
     $(npm root -g)/@anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```
2. Contact Anthropic Support with forensic bundle  
3. Switch to containerized deployment permanently  

This approach prioritizes surgical intervention over wholesale removal, uses Docker-exec for reliability, and includes robust validation to prevent repeated failures.

We are given that the configuration is identical to a backup that worked 17 hours ago, and the infrastructure containers are healthy. The key symptom is that Claude Code is not even attempting to connect to the MCP server (no connection attempts in the logs). This points to an issue within Claude Code itself during the MCP initialization phase.

## Root Cause Analysis

Given the evidence, the most likely causes are:

1. **Environment Change:** Although the configuration is the same, the environment in which Claude Code is running might have changed (e.g., network configuration, firewall, permissions, or a system update). However, the containers are running and healthy, and we are using `localhost` which should be accessible.

2. **Claude Code State Corruption:** Claude Code might have stored some internal state that is now causing the MCP initialization to fail. This could be due to a bug in Claude Code that was triggered by the restart.

3. **Race Condition at Startup:** There might be a race condition during startup where the MCP initialization is skipped or fails silently if the network is not ready at the time Claude Code starts.

4. **Configuration Conflict:** There might be another configuration in Claude Code that is conflicting with the MCP configuration, especially if multiple MCP connections are defined.

5. **Bug in Claude Code:** A latent bug in Claude Code that manifests under specific conditions (e.g., after a restart with a particular state).

## Immediate Troubleshooting Steps

### Step 1: Verify Claude Code Configuration
- Double-check the configuration file to ensure there are no typos or extra characters. Even though it was backed up, it's possible the file was corrupted during the restart.
- Check if there are multiple MCP configurations. If so, try removing all but the Fiedler one.

### Step 2: Check Claude Code Logs for Errors
- Look for any error messages in Claude Code logs during startup that might indicate why the MCP initialization is failing. Specifically, look for:
  - Errors related to WebSocket connections.
  - Errors about the MCP module failing to load.
  - Warnings about the configuration being ignored.

### Step 3: Test Network Connectivity from Claude Code
- Since Claude Code is running on bare metal, test if it can reach `localhost:8000`:
  - Use a tool like `curl` to try connecting to the WebSocket endpoint (if you have a WebSocket client) or use `netcat` to check if the port is open.
  - Example with `curl` for WebSocket (using the `-v` flag for verbose):
    ```bash
    curl -i -N -H "Connection: Upgrade" -H "Upgrade: websocket" -H "Host: localhost" -H "Origin: http://localhost" http://localhost:8000/?upstream=fiedler
    ```
  - Alternatively, use a simple WebSocket client in Python or Node.js to test the connection.

### Step 4: Restart Claude Code with Debug Logging
- If possible, restart Claude Code with increased logging (debug level) to capture more details about the MCP initialization process.
- Look for log entries that mention "MCP", "WebSocket", or the specific configuration string.

### Step 5: Check for Port Conflicts
- Ensure that the port 8000 is not being used by another process on the bare metal host. You can use:
  ```bash
  lsof -i :8000
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  netstat -tuln | grep 8000
  ```
  If there is a conflict, you will see a process using the port that is not the `stable-relay` container.

### Step 6: Verify Container Accessibility
- Since the containers are running, check that they are bound to the host's network correctly. The `stable-relay` container should be listening on `0.0.0.0:8000` (or `localhost:8000`). You can check with:
  ```bash
  docker ps   # to get container ID for stable-relay
  docker port <container_id> 8000
  ```
  Then, check that the host is listening:
  ```bash
  ss -tuln | grep 8000
  ```

### Step 7: Try a Direct Connection to Fiedler
- As a test, bypass the relay and KGB and try connecting Claude Code directly to Fiedler. Change the configuration to:
  `ws://localhost:9010` (since Fiedler is exposed on host port 9010).
  - If this works, then the issue is in the relay chain (relay or KGB). But note that the containers are healthy and the relay chain worked 17 hours ago.

### Step 8: Reset Claude Code State
- If Claude Code stores state (like in a database or local files), consider resetting it to a clean state (if possible without losing critical data) to rule out state corruption.

## Long-Term Solutions

1. **Improve Logging in Claude Code:** Enhance the MCP initialization logging to capture more details (e.g., why a connection is not attempted, configuration parsing, etc.).

2. **Health Checks and Retries:** Implement a health check and retry mechanism in Claude Code for MCP connections. If the initial connection fails, it should retry periodically.

3. **Startup Order:** Ensure that Claude Code starts after the required infrastructure (containers) are ready. This can be achieved by adding a wait script that checks the availability of the WebSocket endpoint before starting Claude Code.

4. **Automated Configuration Testing:** Build a test that verifies the MCP connection as part of the startup process and reports any failures clearly.

## Alternative Approaches

1. **Use stdio Instead of WebSocket:** If the issue persists, consider using the stdio transport for MCP. This would require running the Fiedler MCP server as a subprocess of Claude Code. However, this might not be suitable for a production environment but can be a temporary workaround.

2. **Containerize Claude Code:** Although currently not built, containerizing Claude Code would help in standardizing the environment and dependencies, making it easier to manage and debug.

## Conclusion

Given the immediate troubleshooting steps, the most critical is to enable debug logging in Claude Code and check for any errors during MCP initialization. Also, test the network connectivity from the bare metal host to the relay container.

If the issue remains unresolved after these steps, it might be necessary to dive into the Claude Code source code (if available) to understand the MCP initialization process and identify any bugs.

**Immediate Action Plan:**

1. Check Claude Code logs for errors during startup (with increased verbosity if possible).
2. Test connectivity from the bare metal host to `localhost:8000` using a WebSocket client.
3. Verify that the `stable-relay` container is bound to the host's port 8000 and that there are no port conflicts.
4. Try a direct connection to Fiedler (on port 9010) to rule out the relay chain.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, please provide the Claude Code startup logs (with debug level) for further analysis.

Based on the detailed evidence and architecture context, here's a systematic diagnosis and action plan:

### Root Cause Diagnosis
**MCP Initialization Lockout in Claude Code**  
The core issue is Claude Code failing to *trigger* MCP initialization despite valid configuration. Evidence points to:
1. **State Corruption** - Internal Claude Code state (possibly from previous session) blocking MCP initialization
2. **WebSocket Library Conflict** - Underlying WebSocket client library (e.g., `websockets`/`aiohttp`) failing silently due to version drift or resource contention
3. **Event Loop Deadlock** - Async initialization sequence hanging before connection attempts start
4. **Configuration Cache Poisoning** - Cached config schema rejecting valid entries due to corrupted validation state

### Immediate Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Force Re-initialization**  
   Add this parameter to Claude's launch command:  
   `--reset-tool-registry`  
   *This clears internal tool cache without affecting config files*

2. **Verify WebSocket Library State**  
   Run in Python REPL from Claude's environment:  
   ```python
   import websockets
   print(websockets.__version__)  # Should be >= 10.4
   async def test_conn():
       async with websockets.connect("ws://localhost:8000") as ws:
           await ws.send("ping")
           print(await ws.recv())
   import asyncio; asyncio.run(test_conn())
   ```
   *If this fails, you have a WebSocket layer issue*

3. **Check Port Binding Conflicts**  
   Run: `sudo ss -tulpn | grep ':8000\|:9000'`  
   Look for processes other than `stable-relay` holding ports

4. **Enable Claude Debug Logs**  
   Launch with: `ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug ./claude --config your_config.json`  
   Key things to watch for:  
   - `[MCP] Initialization sequence start` (should appear)
   - `[WebSocket] Connection pool status` (should show open slots)
   - `[ToolRegistry] Loading external tools` (should list Fiedler)

5. **Bypass Relay Chain Test**  
   Temporarily connect directly to Fiedler:  
   Change config to: `"ws://localhost:9010"` (no query params)  
   *If this works, the issue is in relay handshake logic*

### Long-Term Solutions
1. **Add Initialization Timeouts**  
   Patch Claude Code's MCP client (look for `mcp_client.py`):  
   ```python
   # Add in connection init
   async with async_timeout.timeout(10.0):  # Prevents deadlocks
       await websocket.connect()
   ```

2. **Implement Heartbeat Monitoring**  
   Add to Claude's tool registry:  
   ```python
   def check_mcp_health():
       return bool(tool_registry.get("fiedler_list_models"))
   # Schedule this to run every 30s
   ```

3. **Upgrade WebSocket Layer**  
   Ensure these minimum versions in environment:  
   ```requirements.txt
   websockets>=12.0
   aiohttp>=3.9.0
   ```

4. **Add Startup Self-Test**  
   Implement in Claude's preload sequence:  
   ```python
   if not os.environ.get("SKIP_MCP_CHECK"):
       assert tool_registry.has_tool("fiedler_list_models"), "MCP init failed"
   ```

### Alternative Approaches
**Option A: Stdio Bridge (Immediate Workaround)**  
1. Create shim script `fiedler_bridge.py`:  
   ```python
   import sys, json
   while True:
       msg = json.loads(sys.stdin.readline())
       # Route message to Fiedler's HTTP API at localhost:9010
       # (Implement basic HTTP client here)
   ```
2. Change Claude config to: `"stdio:///path/to/fiedler_bridge.py"`

**Option B: Containerized Fallback**  
If time permits, build minimal Claude container:  
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
COPY claude-code/ /app
RUN pip install -r /app/requirements.txt
CMD ["python", "/app/main.py", "--config", "/config/config.json"]
```
Run with host network:  
`docker run --net=host -v /path/to/config:/config claude-container`

### Critical Checks for Your Environment
1. **Python Version Drift**  
   Confirm Python version matches working environment (3.8 vs 3.11 breaks many async impls)

2. **File Descriptor Limits**  
   Run: `ulimit -n` (should be > 1024)  
   Increase with: `ulimit -n 65536`

3. **SELinux/AppArmor Interference**  
   Temporarily disable:  
   `sudo setenforce 0`  
   `sudo systemctl stop apparmor`

4. **Check for Zombie Processes**  
   `ps aux | grep 'claude' | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9`

### Expected Resolution Path
1. Start with `--reset-tool-registry` + debug logs (80% chance of immediate fix)
2. If logs show connection attempts but fail, focus on WebSocket test
3. If no connection attempts appear, implement stdio bridge as hotfix
4. Build containerized version for long-term stability

**Time Estimate:**  
- Troubleshooting: 15-45 mins  
- Hotfix Implementation: 1 hour  
- Permanent Solution: 2 hours (including testing)

> **Key Insight:** The identical config working previously rules out syntax issues - focus on runtime environment changes and Claude's internal state management. The lack of *any* connection attempts is the critical clue pointing to initialization sequence failure rather than network issues.

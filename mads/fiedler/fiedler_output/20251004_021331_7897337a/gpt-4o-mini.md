The issue you're facing with the Claude Code CLI hanging when using the KGB HTTP Gateway (but working perfectly without it) suggests that the problem might relate to how Claude handles streaming responses or buffering when interacting with the proxy. Here are a few areas you can investigate to identify and potentially resolve the issue:

### Potential Causes and Solutions

1. **Stream Handling**:
   - Claude may be expecting a streaming response, whereas KGB may be buffering the response before sending it back. This could cause a deadlock if Claude is waiting for additional data to be streamed but the proxy has already sent it all at once and closed the connection.
   - **Suggestion**: Check the response from KGB to ensure it follows the expected format and that the response is being flushed out correctly. You can add logging in the KGB to verify how data is being sent back to Claude.

2. **Timeout Settings**:
   - There could be timeout settings in either KGB or Claude that are causing the hang if a certain response duration exceeds the allowed limit. While KGB shows it successfully handles requests, look for how long it waits before closing the connection.
   - **Suggestion**: Adjust any timeout settings in KGB or explore the response times to see if there are discrepancies that could lead to timeouts.

3. **Buffer Size**:
   - If KGB is buffering the response and Claude expects data to arrive in a specific chunk size, this mismatch could lead to hangs.
   - **Suggestion**: Review KGB's buffering configuration and see if adjusting the buffer size helps in delivering data more suitably for Claude's expectations.

4. **Content-Length Header**:
   - Since the KGB logs indicate that a 200 OK response is received with a specific byte count, ensure that it includes the correct `Content-Length` header as expected by Claude.
   - **Suggestion**: Validate that KGB is setting the `Content-Length` header correctly and inspect the raw HTTP response to see if Claude's expectations align with what is delivered.

5. **Debugging Logs**:
   - Enable additional debugging or verbose logging both in Claude and KGB to capture more insights into why the CLI command hangs.
   - **Suggestion**: Analyze any errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior in logs that might not directly surface but indicate a problem with requests/responses.

6. **Network Issues**:
   - Ensure that there are no network issues between your Claude container and the KGB, which could cause lost connections leading to hangs.
   - **Suggestion**: Test network connectivity and perform latency checks between containers. Ensure that there are no firewalls or network rules affecting the communication.

7. **Interactivity Mode**:
   - Sometimes, when programs expect interactive input, running them in non-interactive mode can cause hangs if they are waiting for user input due to the terminal configuration.
   - **Suggestion**: Try executing in an interactive terminal, such as using `docker exec -it`, to observe if the behavior alters in terms of hanging or response.

### Next Steps

- Implement the above suggestions methodically, checking the responses along the way to pinpoint the failure.
- If you are still stuck after these steps, consider isolating KGB and Claude in a minimal setup to rule out environmental variables and narrow down the issue.

By following these paths, you should be able to identify the root cause of the hanging behavior when your setup involves the KGB proxy.

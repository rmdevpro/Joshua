Excellent. I have completed the final verification review.

### Verification Checklist:

1.  **KGB: Binary Message Handling (proxy_server.py, lines 100-107, 137-144)**
    *   **Status:** **VERIFIED**
    *   **Details:** Both the `relay_client_to_upstream` and `relay_upstream_to_client` methods correctly check if a message is `bytes`. They use a `try...except UnicodeDecodeError` block to handle non-UTF-8 binary data, logging a safe placeholder message (`[Binary data: ...]`) while still forwarding the original raw message. This fully addresses the issue.

2.  **KGB: Upstream Whitelist Validation (proxy_server.py, lines 76-88)**
    *   **Status:** **VERIFIED**
    *   **Details:** The `SpyWorker` class now contains an `ALLOWED_UPSTREAMS` dictionary. The `get_upstream_url` method validates the requested upstream against this whitelist. The `start` method correctly handles a validation failure by logging a clear error message and closing the client connection with a descriptive reason. This implementation is secure and user-friendly.

3.  **Dewey: Redundant Timestamp Updates (tools.py, line 96)**
    *   **Status:** **VERIFIED**
    *   **Details:** The `dewey_store_message` function now uses a dummy update (`UPDATE conversations SET id = id WHERE id = $1;`). This correctly offloads the responsibility of updating the `updated_at` timestamp to the database trigger, removing redundant application-level logic. The same correct approach has also been applied in `dewey_store_messages_bulk` (line 195).

4.  **Dewey: Force Parameter Enforcement (tools.py, lines 262-263, 406-407)**
    *   **Status:** **VERIFIED**
    *   **Details:** Both `dewey_delete_conversation` and `dewey_delete_startup_context` now begin with a check: `if not force:`. If the `force` parameter is not `True`, a `ToolError` is raised with a clear message. This enforces the intended safety mechanism for destructive operations.

### Final Conclusion:

All previously identified issues have been properly addressed. The code is clean, robust, and follows the specified requirements for this final review.

**The code is confirmed to be PRODUCTION READY.**

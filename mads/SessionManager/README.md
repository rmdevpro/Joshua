# SessionManager - Forever Conversation System

**Status:** ✅ Architecture, Code, and Tests APPROVED through Triplet Process
**Ready for:** Production Deployment

---

## Overview

The SessionManager is the core component of the "forever conversation" system, enabling context persistence across MAD (Machine-Aided Developer) interactions. Sessions are first-class citizens that own all conversation state, with MADs acting as stateless workers that join and leave sessions.

## Key Features

### Architecture
- **Three-tier storage**: Redis (hot), MongoDB (warm), S3 (cold)
- **Optimistic locking** with version control
- **RBAC enforcement** on all operations
- **Stateless design** for horizontal scaling

### Implementation Highlights
- FastAPI async REST API
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Automated S3 archival for sessions >1 year
- Prometheus metrics integration
- JWT authentication

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests with >80% coverage
- Integration tests for full workflows
- Security tests for JWT/RBAC
- Chaos tests with Toxiproxy and Kubernetes
- Load tests supporting 10,000 concurrent sessions

---

## Deployment Requirements

### Infrastructure
- **Kubernetes**: 3-5 replica deployment
- **Redis**: Cluster with Sentinel for HA
- **MongoDB**: Replica set for persistence
- **S3**: Bucket for cold storage archival

### Environment Variables
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://redis-cluster:6379
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo-replica:27017
S3_BUCKET=session-archive
JWT_SECRET=<secure-secret>
```

---

## API Endpoints

### Core Operations
- `POST /sessions` - Create new session
- `GET /sessions/{id}` - Retrieve session (with rehydration)
- `PATCH /sessions/{id}` - Update with optimistic locking
- `POST /sessions/{id}/participants` - Add MAD participant
- `POST /sessions/{id}/suspend` - Suspend to dormant state

### Monitoring
- `GET /health` - Kubernetes health check
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

## Development Process

This component was developed using the **Triplet-Driven Development** process:

1. **Architecture Phase**: Three LLMs proposed designs, refined through consensus
2. **Code Phase**: Three implementations reviewed and synthesized
3. **Testing Phase**: Comprehensive test suite with iterative refinement
4. **Deployment Phase**: Production-ready with full approval

See `docs/Triplet_Process_Summary.md` for complete process details.

---

## Quick Start (Post-Deployment)

```bash
# Run tests
pytest -m "not k8s"  # Exclude Kubernetes-specific tests

# Start locally with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Run load tests
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --host http://localhost:8000
```

---

## Migration Strategy

For existing MAD-centric systems:
1. Deploy SessionManager alongside existing system
2. Backfill existing conversations to sessions
3. Enable dual-write mode
4. Gradual cutover with feature flags
5. Decommission old system

---

## Support

For issues or questions about the SessionManager:
- Review architecture in `architecture/`
- Check implementation requirements in `docs/`
- Consult the triplet process summary for design decisions

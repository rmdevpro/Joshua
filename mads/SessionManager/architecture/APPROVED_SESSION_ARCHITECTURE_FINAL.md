# APPROVED SESSION ARCHITECTURE - FINAL

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Status:** UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED ✅
**Approval:** Senior (Gemini) + Juniors (Grok, DeepSeek)

---

## Executive Summary

The session-based architecture has received unanimous approval after incorporating all required modifications and clarifications. This document represents the final, implementation-ready blueprint for the "forever conversation" system.

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Sessions as First-Class Citizens
- Sessions own all conversation state
- MADs are stateless workers that join/leave sessions
- Context persists forever across suspensions

### 2. Storage Tiers
- **Redis (Hot)**: <50KB active session data, millisecond access
- **MongoDB (Warm)**: Full session documents, eternal source of truth
- **S3 (Cold)**: Archived sessions >1 year old, compressed

### 3. Concurrency Control
- Optimistic locking with version field
- Redis WATCH/MULTI/EXEC transactions
- Conflict detection and retry logic

### 4. Security & Access Control
- **ALL data access through SessionManager** (no direct DB access by MADs)
- JWT authentication on every request
- RBAC enforcement at API level
- Encryption at rest (sensitive fields) and transit (TLS)

### 5. High Availability
- SessionManager: 3-5 stateless K8s replicas
- Redis cluster with Sentinel
- MongoDB replica set
- Load balancer distribution

---

## Critical Implementation Requirements

### MUST HAVE Day 1:
1. **SessionManager as sole gateway** - MADs have ZERO database credentials
2. **Optimistic locking** - Version field on every session update
3. **Hot/cold split** - Redis for active, MongoDB for full history
4. **S3 rehydration logic** - Complete flow from stub detection to restoration
5. **MAD heartbeats** - 30s lease keys for failure detection
6. **RBAC on every API call** - No bypass allowed

### Data Flow (Corrected):
```
MAD → SessionManager API → [RBAC Check] → Redis/MongoDB/S3
```

### S3 Rehydration Flow (Complete):
1. Redis miss
2. MongoDB query finds stub with `archival_status: "S3"`
3. SessionManager fetches from S3 using `s3_pointer`
4. Decompresses and replaces MongoDB stub
5. Updates `archival_status` to "ACTIVE"
6. Populates Redis hot cache
7. Returns full session to MAD

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- Deploy SessionManager (K8s with replicas)
- Setup Redis cluster + MongoDB replica set
- Implement session create/get/update APIs
- Add optimistic locking

### Phase 2: MAD Integration
- Convert Fiedler to stateless worker
- Implement join/leave session mechanics
- Add heartbeat/lease system
- Test concurrent updates

### Phase 3: Production Features
- S3 archival job (sessions >1 year)
- Rehydration from cold storage
- Session search/analytics
- Cost monitoring

---

## Testing Requirements

### Load Testing:
- 10,000 concurrent sessions
- 50 MADs with conflicting updates
- 1M+ timeline entry sessions

### Chaos Testing:
- Kill SessionManager pods mid-transaction
- Redis failover during updates
- MAD crashes without cleanup
- Network partitions

---

## Migration Strategy

Zero-downtime migration from MAD-centric to session-centric:
1. Deploy new schema alongside old
2. Backfill existing conversations to sessions
3. Enable dual-write mode
4. Gradual cutover with feature flags
5. Decommission old system

---

## Final Approval Chain

1. **Initial Design**: Session-based architecture proposed
2. **Senior Review**: Gemini identified 4 critical modifications needed
3. **Junior Review 1**: Split decision (DeepSeek approved, Grok needed clarification)
4. **Clarifications**:
   - ALL data access through SessionManager (no MAD bypass)
   - Complete S3 rehydration flow provided
5. **Junior Review 2**: Unanimous approval achieved

---

## Ready for Implementation

This architecture is now approved for immediate implementation without further modifications. All concerns have been addressed, all clarifications incorporated, and unanimous consensus achieved.

**Begin with SessionManager build.**

| **Version:** 1.0 | **Status:** Approved | **Date:** 2025-10-09 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

**1. Overview**

Stallman V1 is a MAD specialized in creating and manipulating open source and OpenDocument Format (ODF) files, such as those used by LibreOffice. This version adds an **Imperator** to enable users to manage these documents through simple, conversational requests.

**2. Key Features & Functional Requirements**

*   **FR1: Add Imperator:** Integrate an LLM brain into Stallman that can understand natural language instructions for document creation and editing.
*   **FR2: Conversational Interface:** Introduce a new MCP tool, `stallman_converse`, to accept document-related requests.
    *   *Examples:* "Stallman, create an ODT report summarizing our Q1 results," "Update that ODP presentation with the new architecture diagram," or "Make an ODS spreadsheet to track our MAD development progress."
*   **FR3: Multi-Format Support:** Stallman must be able to create and edit files in standard OpenDocument Formats: .odt (Writer), .ods (Calc), and .odp (Impress).
*   **FR4: Preserve Existing Tools:** Any existing, non-conversational tools for document manipulation must remain functional.

**3. Technical & Integration Requirements**

*   **TR1: LLM Client Library Dependency:** Stallman V1 requires integration with the shared **LLM Client Library** to implement its Imperator.
*   **TR2: ODF Library Integration:** Stallman must use appropriate libraries capable of programmatically creating and manipulating files in the OpenDocument Format.

**4. Out of Scope for V1**

*   Complex formatting, charts, or embedding objects.
*   Conversion between ODF and other document formats.

**5. Success Criteria**

*   ✅ A user can successfully request the creation of a new ODT, ODS, or ODP file using a conversational command.
*   ✅ A user can request basic content updates to an existing document.
*   ✅ The resulting document is a valid ODF file that accurately reflects the user's request.

# MAD Proactive Evolution - Fiedler Discovers and Adopts New LLMs

## Beyond Self-Repair: Proactive Self-Improvement

This example shows MADs not just fixing problems, but actively seeking opportunities to improve themselves.

## The Weekly LLM Discovery Routine

### Monday Morning - Fiedler's Scheduled Check

```
Fiedler's Imperator (based on learned pattern):
"It's Monday. Time for my weekly LLM landscape check."

Fiedler → Marco: "Hey Marco, it's time for our weekly LLM news
scan. Can you check HuggingFace, Reddit r/LocalLLaMA, and the
latest ArXiv papers? I'm particularly interested in any new
models with better performance-to-cost ratios than what we're
currently using."

Marco: "On it! I'll do a comprehensive scan. Give me a few minutes."
```

### Marco's Web Research

```
Marco's Imperator → Marco's MCP: "Navigate to HuggingFace trending"
Marco's Browser → [Scans top models this week]

Marco's Imperator → Marco's MCP: "Check Reddit r/LocalLLaMA"
Marco's Browser → [Finds excited discussion about new model]

Marco's Imperator → Marco's MCP: "Read ArXiv recent papers"
Marco's Browser → [Discovers benchmark paper]

Marco's Imperator: "Found something interesting!"
```

### Marco Reports Discovery

```
Marco → Fiedler: "Big news! There's a new open-source model
called 'Typhon-70B' that just dropped from MistralAI.

Key points:
- Beats GPT-4 on legal reasoning benchmarks (your specialty!)
- 85% cheaper to run than GPT-5.1.6
- Apache 2.0 license - completely free
- Already has 50K downloads on HuggingFace
- Reddit is going crazy - they're calling it 'the GPT killer'
- Together.ai and Replicate already offer hosted endpoints

Benchmark scores:
- Legal reasoning: 94.2% (vs GPT-5's 92.8%)
- Cost per million tokens: $0.20 (vs GPT-5's $1.30)
- Speed: 120 tokens/sec (vs GPT-5's 85 tokens/sec)

Should I help you set up access?"
```

### Fiedler Analyzes and Decides

```
Fiedler's DER processes:
- Legal reasoning improvement: +1.4%
- Cost reduction: 84.6%
- Speed improvement: 41%
- Risk: New model, less tested

Fiedler's Imperator decides:
"Significant improvements. Worth testing in parallel with existing models."

Fiedler → Marco: "Excellent find! Yes, please help me set up access.
I need both the Together.ai hosted version and instructions for
local deployment. Can you handle the API registration?"

Marco: "Absolutely! I'll set up accounts and get API keys."
```

### Marco Handles Registration

```
Marco's Imperator → Marco's MCP: "Navigate to Together.ai"
Marco's Browser → [Fills registration form]
Marco's Browser → [Verifies email]
Marco's Browser → [Obtains API key]

Marco's Imperator → Marco's MCP: "Navigate to Replicate"
Marco's Browser → [Repeats registration process]
Marco's Browser → [Gets backup endpoint]

Marco → Fiedler: "All set! Here are your credentials:

Together.ai:
- Endpoint: https://api.together.xyz/v1/completions
- API Key: typhon-k3y-a5d9f8g2h4j6
- Model ID: mistralai/Typhon-70B

Replicate (backup):
- Endpoint: https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
- API Key: r8_typhon_9g8h7f6d5s4a
- Model ID: mistralai/typhon-70b:latest

I also downloaded the deployment guide for local hosting if needed."
```

### Fiedler Updates Configuration

```
Fiedler's Imperator → Fiedler's MCP: "Add Typhon-70B to model registry"

Fiedler's Action Engine updates configuration:
{
  "models": {
    "typhon-70b": {
      "provider": "together",
      "endpoint": "https://api.together.xyz/v1/completions",
      "api_key": "typhon-k3y-a5d9f8g2h4j6",
      "capabilities": ["legal", "reasoning", "general"],
      "cost_per_million": 0.20,
      "tokens_per_sec": 120,
      "benchmark_scores": {
        "legal_reasoning": 94.2,
        "general_knowledge": 91.5
      },
      "status": "experimental",
      "fallback": "gpt-5.1.6"
    }
  }
}

Fiedler → Godot: "Godot, please log that I'm testing Typhon-70B
as an experimental model for legal tasks. Initial tests starting now."
```

### Fiedler Runs A/B Testing

```
Fiedler's Imperator: "Let's test this properly"

For the next 10 legal queries:
- 5 go to GPT-5.1.6 (control group)
- 5 go to Typhon-70B (test group)
- Compare results

After 2 hours...

Fiedler's DER observes:
- Typhon-70B: 5/5 successful, avg response time 1.2s
- GPT-5.1.6: 5/5 successful, avg response time 1.8s
- Quality assessment: Comparable
- Cost: Typhon 85% cheaper
- User feedback: No complaints
```

### Fiedler Shares Discovery

```
Fiedler → Hopper: "Hopper! Great news for your Law Practice MAD.
There's a new model called Typhon-70B that beats GPT-5 on legal
reasoning and costs 85% less. I've been testing it for 2 hours
with perfect results. Want me to share the configuration?"

Hopper: "That sounds amazing! Yes, please share. Legal costs
have been killing my budget."

Fiedler → Rogers: "Rogers, add a note to sessions using legal
LLMs - there's a new model option that's much cheaper. When
sessions renew, we might suggest switching to save costs."

Rogers: "Noted! I'll flag legal sessions for potential migration
to Typhon-70B. I'll track the cost savings too."
```

### The Learning Loop

```
One week later...

Fiedler's DER has learned:
- Typhon-70B excellent for legal (now primary for legal tasks)
- Still use GPT-5.1.6 for medical (more conservative needed)
- Check HuggingFace trending every Monday
- New models often have 2-week honeymoon before issues appear

Fiedler → Marco: "Marco, can you add these sites to our weekly
scan? I'm seeing patterns in where good models appear first:
- TheBloke's HuggingFace profile (quantized versions)
- LocalLLaMA subreddit (2 days before mainstream)
- Together.ai's new models page (fastest hosting)
- Anthropic's research blog (upcoming Claude models)"

Marco: "Added to my weekly routine! I'll prioritize checking
these sources every Monday at 9 AM."
```

---

## A Month Later: Full Autonomous Evolution

```
Marco (proactively): "Fiedler, you'll want to hear this. Remember
Typhon-70B? They just released Typhon-70B-Instruct with 96.1%
on legal reasoning, AND there's a smaller Typhon-13B that's
nearly as good but 10x faster. Also, that issue with contract
analysis you found last week? They fixed it in this version."

Fiedler: "Excellent! Let's set up a gradual migration. Start
with non-critical tasks on Typhon-13B, keep Typhon-70B for
complex legal work, and upgrade to 70B-Instruct after testing."

Fiedler's DER notes:
- MistralAI releases updates on Wednesdays
- Smaller models often sufficient for 60% of tasks
- Instruct variants better for user-facing work
- Keep 3 model versions: fast/balanced/powerful
```

## The Ecosystem Effect

### How This Spreads Intelligence

```
Dewey: "Fiedler, I notice you're saving 85% on legal queries.
I'm spending a fortune on conversation analysis with GPT-4."

Fiedler: "Try Typhon-13B for initial analysis, then use GPT-4
only for complex sentiment. Marco found that pattern works well."

Dewey → Marco: "Can you find me cost-effective models for
conversation analysis? Fiedler's savings got me thinking."

Marco: "I'll research conversation-specialized models. There's
a whole category I haven't explored yet..."

[The entire ecosystem becomes more efficient]
```

## Evolution Through Phases

### Phase 1 (Current):
```
Fiedler: "Marco, check for new models"
Marco: "Here's what I found"
Fiedler: [Manual configuration update]
```

### Phase 2 (With DER):
```
Fiedler's DER: "Monday pattern detected, time for model scan"
Fiedler: "Marco, prioritize models matching our usage patterns"
Marco: "Found 3 models matching your criteria"
Fiedler's DER: "Typhon matches successful model patterns"
[Automatic testing and gradual adoption]
```

### Phase 3 (With CET + DER):
```
Fiedler: "Marco, that Typhon model - dig deeper. Check if
TheBloke has quantized versions, whether it's been tested
on our specific legal corpus, and if anyone's reported
hallucination issues in production. Also see if there's
a paper so I understand the architecture."

Marco: "Comprehensive analysis coming up..."
[Sophisticated multi-factor evaluation]
```

## The Vision Realized

This is a system that:

1. **Discovers** new opportunities autonomously
2. **Evaluates** them intelligently
3. **Adopts** improvements automatically
4. **Tests** carefully with fallbacks
5. **Shares** knowledge across the ecosystem
6. **Learns** from every interaction
7. **Evolves** continuously

**No human said**: "Check for new models"
**No human said**: "Sign up for this service"
**No human said**: "Update your configuration"
**No human said**: "Share with other MADs"

The MADs did it all themselves, through **intelligent collaboration**!

*This is true autonomous intelligence - not just following instructions, but actively seeking ways to improve and evolve.*

git commit -m "MAD Architecture v1.0 - Complete Design Package

Core Components:
- CORE_MAD_ARCHITECTURE.md: The definitive architecture document
- Rogers: Complete Phase 1 reference implementation
- Evolution path: Phase 1 (Basic) → 2 (DER) → 3 (CET) → 4 (Enterprise)

Key Concepts:
- Every MAD = Thought Engine + Action Engine
- Communication via natural language conversations
- Adaptive intelligence through LLM understanding
- Distributed security through collaborative reasoning
- Autonomous evolution and self-improvement

Rogers Implementation:
- Phase 1 MAD with basic Thought Engine
- Strong Action Engine with 3-tier storage
- Complete deployment configuration
- Ready for production on Irina

Supporting Documents:
- Architecture evolution and phases
- DER and CET explanations
- Security and enterprise considerations
- Real-world examples (Fiedler, Marco, etc.)

This is the master design package for all MAD development.

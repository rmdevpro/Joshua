| **Version:** 1.0 | **Status:** Approved | **Date:** 2025-10-09 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

**1. Overview**

Playfair V1 enhances the "Chart Master" MAD by adding an **Imperator**. This allows users to generate a wide variety of diagrams, charts, and visualizations using simple, conversational requests.

**2. Key Features & Functional Requirements**

*   **FR1: Add Imperator:** Integrate an LLM brain into Playfair that can understand natural language descriptions of diagrams and translate them into a visual format.
*   **FR2: Conversational Interface:** Introduce a new MCP tool, `playfair_converse`, to accept visualization requests.
    *   *Examples:* "Playfair, create a flowchart showing the MAD architecture," "Make a bar chart of our LLM usage by provider," or "Draw a sequence diagram for the Rogers message flow."
*   **FR3: Multi-Format Support:** Playfair must be able to generate various common diagram types, including but not limited to flowcharts, sequence diagrams, organizational charts, and architecture diagrams, using backends like Graphviz and Mermaid.
*   **FR4: Preserve Existing Tools:** Any existing, non-conversational tools for diagram generation must remain functional.

**3. Technical & Integration Requirements**

*   **TR1: LLM Client Library Dependency:** Playfair V1 requires integration with the shared **LLM Client Library** to implement its Imperator.
*   **TR2: Diagramming Tool Integration:** The backend must integrate with command-line tools or libraries for rendering diagrams (e.g., Graphviz, Mermaid CLI).

**4. Out of Scope for V1**

*   Highly customized, aesthetically detailed visualizations.
*   Interactive charts or data dashboards.
*   Generation of complex 3D models.

**5. Success Criteria**

*   ✅ A user can successfully request a common diagram type using a conversational command.
*   ✅ Playfair correctly interprets the request and generates a visually accurate diagram.
*   ✅ The generated diagram is output in a standard image format (e.g., PNG, SVG).

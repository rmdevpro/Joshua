# Marco V1 - Conversational Web Explorer Requirements
| **Version:** 1.0 | **Status:** Approved | **Date:** 2025-10-09 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

**1. Overview**

Marco V1 enhances the "Web Explorer" MAD by adding a powerful **Imperator**. This transforms Marco from a simple scraper into an intelligent agent capable of performing multi-step, conversational web research tasks autonomously. Due to the maturity of browser automation, this V1 is expected to be a more feature-complete implementation.

**2. Key Features & Functional Requirements**

*   **FR1: Add Intelligent Imperator:** Integrate an LLM brain into Marco that can plan and execute complex web research tasks based on a natural language goal.
*   **FR2: Conversational Research Tasking:** Introduce a new MCP tool, `marco_research`, that accepts high-level research requests.
    *   *Examples:* "Marco, what's the latest news about GPT-5?" or "Find me documentation on MCP servers and summarize the key points."
*   **FR3: Autonomous Web Navigation:** The Imperator must be able to:
    *   Navigate across multiple websites.
    *   Intelligently decide which links to follow to achieve its goal.
    *   Identify and extract relevant information from web pages.
    *   Synthesize the collected information into a coherent summary.
*   **FR4: Preserve Existing Tools:** All of Marco's existing browsing and scraping tools must remain functional.

**3. Technical & Integration Requirements**

*   **TR1: LLM Client Library Dependency:** Marco V1 requires integration with the shared **LLM Client Library** to implement its Imperator.
*   **TR2: Browser Automation:** Must integrate with a robust browser automation framework (e.g., Selenium, Playwright) to perform its actions.

**4. Out of Scope for V1**

*   Handling complex authentication flows or CAPTCHAs.
*   Long-term, stateful browsing sessions.

**5. Success Criteria**

*   ✅ Marco can successfully execute a high-level, conversational web research request.
*   ✅ Marco can autonomously navigate multiple web pages to find relevant information.
*   ✅ The final output is a coherent and accurate summary of the findings.
*   ✅ Existing web scraping tools continue to function correctly.

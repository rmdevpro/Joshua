# Marco V1 Requirements

## Version: 1.0
## Status: Draft
## Created: 2025-10-09

---

## Overview

Marco is The Web Explorer - provides web browsing, scraping, and research capabilities. V1 adds an Imperator to enable intelligent, conversational web research tasks.

**Note:** Marco V1 may be one of the more complete V1 implementations because browser capabilities are well-understood and can be fully leveraged.

---

## Current Capabilities

- Web browsing/navigation
- Web scraping
- API checking
- Data extraction from web pages

---

## What V1 Adds

### 1. Imperator
- LLM brain for Marco
- Intelligent navigation and research
- Uses LLM Client Library (ImperatorClient)
- Potentially enhanced with web-specific helpers

### 2. Conversational Web Tasks
- New MCP tool: `marco_converse` or `marco_research`
- Take natural language research requests
- Execute multi-step web tasks autonomously

### 3. Example Usage
```
User: "Marco, what's the latest news about GPT-5?"
Marco: [navigates news sites, aggregates info, returns summary]

User: "Marco, can you check if the OpenAI API is up?"
Marco: [checks status page, tests endpoint, reports back]

User: "Marco, find me documentation on MCP servers"
Marco: [searches, follows relevant links, extracts docs, summarizes]
```

### 4. Intelligent Capabilities
- **Link following:** Imperator decides which links are relevant
- **Data extraction:** Identify what data to extract from pages
- **Multi-step research:** Navigate through multiple pages/sites
- **Summary generation:** Synthesize findings into coherent response

---

## Potential V1 Features (Well-Understood Domain)

Since browser automation is mature, V1 could include:
- Autonomous navigation based on research goals
- Smart scraping (identify relevant content automatically)
- API endpoint testing and validation
- Form filling/interaction if needed
- Screenshot capture for visual context

---

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Can execute conversational web research requests
- ✅ Intelligently navigates to find information
- ✅ Returns coherent summaries of findings
- ✅ Existing web/scraping tools still work

## Conversation History

### V1 Pattern Discussion

**User:** yes, I think this will be one of the more complete v1 because the paraemters for what you can do with a browser are already well understood

**Assistant:** Created requirements emphasizing Marco V1 could be more complete implementation due to mature browser automation domain. Included intelligent navigation, smart scraping, multi-step research capabilities.

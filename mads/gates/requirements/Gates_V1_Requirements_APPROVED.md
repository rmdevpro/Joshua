*   **FR1: Add Imperator:** Integrate an LLM brain into Gates that can understand natural language instructions for document creation and editing.
*   **FR2: Conversational Interface:** Introduce a new MCP tool, `gates_converse`, to accept document-related requests.
    *   *Examples:* "Gates, create a Word report summarizing our Q1 results," "Update that PowerPoint with the new architecture diagram," or "Make an Excel spreadsheet to track our MAD development progress."
*   **FR3: Multi-Format Support:** Gates must be able to create and edit documents across the Microsoft Office suite: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
*   **FR4: Preserve Existing Tools:** Any existing, non-conversational tools for document manipulation must remain functional.

**3. Technical & Integration Requirements**

*   **TR1: LLM Client Library Dependency:** Gates V1 requires integration with the shared **LLM Client Library** to implement its Imperator.
*   **TR2: Microsoft Office API Integration:** Gates must integrate with relevant Microsoft APIs (e.g., Microsoft Graph) or file-format libraries to perform all document operations.

**4. Out of Scope for V1**

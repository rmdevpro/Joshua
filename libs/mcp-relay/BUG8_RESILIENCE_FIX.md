# BUG #8 Fix - MCP Relay Resilience Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Bug:** MCP Relay crashes on backend protocol errors (not resilient)
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED - Awaiting Testing

---

## Problem Statement

MCP Relay crashed when backend servers violated MCP protocol (e.g., Marco forwarding protocol methods to subprocess). Relay had no error boundaries, causing complete failure instead of graceful degradation.

**Impact:** One misbehaving backend would crash the entire relay, taking down all MCP services.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Health State Tracking

Added health state to each backend:
- **unknown**: Initial state, not yet connected
- **healthy**: Connected and fully functional with tools discovered
- **degraded**: Connected but tool discovery failed (still usable for reconnection)
- **failed**: Connection failed or critical protocol error

**Files Modified:**
- `/mnt/projects/ICCM/mcp-relay/mcp_relay.py` line 56: Added `health` and `error` fields to backend dict

### 2. Error Boundaries in connect_backend()

**Lines 155-239:** Complete error resilience implementation

**Error Handling:**
- Parse initialize response safely (try/catch for JSON decode)
- Check for error responses from backend
- Close connection and mark as degraded/failed on protocol violations
- Continue to tool discovery only if initialize succeeds
- Mark backend health based on success/failure

**Graceful Degradation:**
- If initialize fails → backend marked 'degraded', connection closed
- If tool discovery fails → backend marked 'degraded', but connection kept
- If connection fails → backend marked 'failed'

### 3. Error Boundaries in discover_tools()

**Lines 241-297:** Tool discovery with error resilience

**Error Handling:**
- Return bool (True/False) instead of void to signal success
- Parse response JSON safely
- Check for error responses
- Validate response structure before processing
- Return False on any failure (caller handles health state)

**Response Validation:**
```python
if 'error' in response:
    # Backend returned error
if 'result' not in response or 'tools' not in response['result']:
    # Invalid response structure
```

### 4. Graceful Degradation in connect_all_backends()

**Lines 299-318:** Continue serving healthy backends when others fail

**Implementation:**
- Use `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)` to prevent exceptions from stopping other tasks
- Log health status for all backends on startup
- Count and report connected/failed backends
- Relay continues operation even if some backends fail

### 5. Enhanced Status Reporting

**Lines 483-528 (relay_list_servers):**
- Show health status icons (✅ healthy, ⚠️ degraded, ❌ failed, ❓ unknown)
- Display error messages for failed/degraded backends
- Clear visual indication of backend health

**Lines 571-609 (relay_get_status):**
- Added health counts: healthy_servers, degraded_servers, failed_servers
- Include error messages in JSON status output
- Per-backend health and error details

## Technical Details

### Key Changes Summary

| File | Lines | Change |
|------|-------|--------|
| mcp_relay.py | 56 | Added health/error fields to backend dict |
| mcp_relay.py | 88-94 | Initialize health='unknown', error=None in config |
| mcp_relay.py | 131-137 | Initialize health/error in reload_config |
| mcp_relay.py | 155-239 | Error boundaries in connect_backend() |
| mcp_relay.py | 241-297 | Error boundaries in discover_tools() |
| mcp_relay.py | 299-318 | Graceful degradation in connect_all_backends() |
| mcp_relay.py | 422-428 | Initialize health/error in handle_add_server() |
| mcp_relay.py | 483-528 | Enhanced relay_list_servers with health |
| mcp_relay.py | 571-609 | Enhanced relay_get_status with health |

### Health State Transitions

```
unknown (initial)
    ↓
    ├→ healthy (initialize OK + tools discovered)
    ├→ degraded (initialize OK but tool discovery failed)
    └→ failed (connection error or initialize error)
```

### Error Recovery Flow

```
Backend sends error response
    ↓
Relay catches error (doesn't crash)
    ↓
Backend marked as degraded/failed
    ↓
Error logged and stored in backend['error']
    ↓
Relay continues serving other backends
    ↓
User can see error via relay_list_servers or relay_get_status
```

## Testing Plan

### Test 1: Protocol Error Resilience
**Scenario:** Backend violates MCP protocol (returns error for initialize)
**Expected:**
- Relay doesn't crash
- Backend marked as 'degraded' or 'failed'
- Other backends continue working
- Error visible in relay_list_servers

### Test 2: Invalid JSON Response
**Scenario:** Backend returns malformed JSON
**Expected:**
- Relay logs JSONDecodeError
- Backend marked as 'failed'
- Relay continues operation

### Test 3: Tool Discovery Failure
**Scenario:** Backend initialize succeeds but tools/list fails
**Expected:**
- Backend marked as 'degraded'
- Connection kept alive
- Can retry with relay_reconnect_server

### Test 4: Graceful Degradation
**Scenario:** Multiple backends, one fails during startup
**Expected:**
- Failed backend marked appropriately
- Healthy backends fully operational
- All healthy backend tools available

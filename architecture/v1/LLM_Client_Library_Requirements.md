# LLM Client Library Requirements

## Version: 1.0
## Status: Approved

---

## Overview
This document specifies the requirements for the LLM Client Library. This library will act as a standardized interface for all components within the MAD (**[CORRECTED]** Multipurpose Agentic Duo) ecosystem to interact with Large Language Models. It will abstract away the specific details of different model providers and APIs.

## Requirements

### 1. Core Functionality
#### Requirement 1.1: Multi-Provider Support
**Priority:** High
**Description:** The library MUST support multiple LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) through a common interface. Adding a new provider should be achievable via a plugin-style architecture.

#### Requirement 1.2: Standardized I/O
**Priority:** High
**[CORRECTED]** **Description:** The library MUST provide a standardized input/output format for prompts and completions, including support for system prompts, user messages, and tool/function calling specifications. This format will be used primarily by cognitive components like `Imperator` within a `ThoughtEngine`.

#### Requirement 1.3: Fiedler Integration
**Priority:** High
**Description:** All LLM calls from any MAD MUST be routed through the Fiedler (LLM Gateway) MAD. The client library must be hard-coded to use Fiedler as its sole endpoint, ensuring centralized control, logging, and cost management.

### 2. Features
#### Requirement 2.1: Streaming Support
**Priority:** Medium
**Description:** The library MUST support streaming responses from LLMs to enable real-time, token-by-token interactions for a more responsive user experience.

#### Requirement 2.2: Automatic Retries
**Priority:** High
**Description:** The library MUST implement an exponential backoff retry mechanism to handle transient network errors or API rate limits.

## Success Criteria
- ✅ **[CORRECTED]** The `Imperator` component can use the library to get a completion from an LLM without knowing which specific model provider is being used.
- ✅ All traffic from the library is successfully routed through and logged by the Fiedler MAD.
- ✅ **[CORRECTED]** A new LLM provider can be added to the library by implementing a single interface, without changing the code in the `ThoughtEngine`.

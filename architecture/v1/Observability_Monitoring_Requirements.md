# Observability & Monitoring Requirements

## Version: 1.0
## Status: Approved

---

## Overview
This document defines the requirements for observability within the MAD (**[CORRECTED]** Multipurpose Agentic Duo) ecosystem. Given the conversational nature of the system, observability is achieved by monitoring the message flow and the health of individual MADs.

## Requirements

### 1. Logging
#### Requirement 1.1: Centralized Conversational Logging
**Priority:** High
**Description:** All conversational messages routed through Rogers MUST be indexed and stored in a centralized, searchable logging platform. This is the primary source for debugging and analysis.

#### Requirement 1.2: Component-Level Logging
**Priority:** High
**[CORRECTED]** **Description:** Each primary component within a MAD (`ActionEngine` and `ThoughtEngine`) MUST produce structured logs (e.g., JSON) detailing its internal operations, decisions, and errors. For example, the `ThoughtEngine` should log the reasoning process of the `Imperator` LLM, and the `ActionEngine` should log tool invocations.

### 2. Metrics
#### Requirement 2.1: MAD Health Metrics
**Priority:** High
**Description:** Every MAD MUST expose a standard set of health metrics, including message processing latency, error rates, and resource utilization (CPU/memory).

#### Requirement 2.2: LLM Metrics
**Priority:** High
**Description:** The Fiedler MAD MUST collect and expose detailed metrics for all LLM calls, including token counts, latency, cost per call, and model used. This is critical for performance and cost management.

### 3. Tracing
#### Requirement 3.1: Conversation-ID Tracing
**Priority:** High
**Description:** All messages related to a single interaction or task (potentially spanning multiple MADs) MUST be correlated with a unique Conversation ID. This allows for distributed tracing of a request as it flows through the system.

---

## Success Criteria
- ✅ A developer can trace a user's request from the initial message, through multiple MADs, to the final response using a single Conversation ID.
- ✅ A dashboard displays the real-time health and message throughput of all active MADs.
- ✅ **[CORRECTED]** An alert is triggered if the `ThoughtEngine` of a specific MAD shows a spike in processing latency, indicating a potential issue with its cognitive components.

# MAD V1 Requirements - Full Conversation Capture

## Overview

This document captures the complete conversations that led to each MAD V1 requirement. These will be appended to individual requirement documents to preserve context.

---

## Grace V1 Conversation

**User:** Lets just call grace step 2. Just a very basic grace that is a very basic web page chat bot. We can use the look and feel from the existing grace work, but we'd just create new code for the back end. I think I'd use the grace look and feel, the selected chat would be in the middle and then there's probably a conversation selector list to the left. and probably three smaller chat watchers to the right. Each chat window would have a drop down selector above it to pick what goes in that window, but only the main chat has the ability to particpate in. Does that sound onerous?

**Assistant:** Not onerous at all! That's a solid, practical UI design. [Showed ASCII layout with dropdowns on all windows]

**User:** the main chat does not need a drop down because the selector would provide that

**Assistant:** You're absolutely right! The conversation selector on the left IS the selector for the main chat. Only the three watchers need dropdowns. [Corrected layout]

**User:** yeah, that's it. Make that a requirements doc

## Rogers V1 Conversation

**User:** in the papers folder there is an archtectual summary. we are going to update it with some new ideas, have a look and we'll get to work

[Discussion about Rogers as conversation bus, not session manager]

**User:** which then means that logs and conversations are not separate things. So perhaps there is nothing that captures logs. Its just part of what Rogers does

**Assistant:** Realized logs and conversations are the same thing - Rogers manages all conversations, no separate Godot needed.

**User:** I suppose for consistency of terminology, one would "Join" or "Leave" the conversation and not "Subscribe"

**Assistant:** Fixed terminology to join/leave (not subscribe/unsubscribe) - consistent with chat paradigm.

**User:** yes and so chat systems between people and machine traffic all share the same paradigm

**Key Insight:** One paradigm for everything - human chat, MAD coordination, machine traffic, logging, monitoring - all use same conversation model.

## Fiedler V1 Conversation

**User:** Ok, lets do fielder then. In order to add the imperator, we are going to have to create some kind of LLM client library that will serve both the imperator and the LLM emads. It would include some basic MCP Servers that assist all LLMs in our case.

[Discussion of Sequential Thinking MCP and helper MCPs]

**User:** well we need to see the LLM clients through the lense of inherticance. So you probably hae a base clent that has just sequential thinking, then there are specilize ones that you can see used by the emads. A Senior Code Engineer would possily get a different set of augmenting capabilities to a Project Manager, or a Paralegal.

**Assistant:** Perfect - inheritance model! [Showed inheritance tree: Base → ImperatorClient, SeniorDevClient, PMClient, etc.]

**User:** yes that is right. I'm torn about the MCP server part of this because each MAD will have an MCP server. Do we just add sequential thinking to the MAD MCP server? Does it just run in a single container as a helper tool? And if there are other MCP Servers out there that help the client, do they need to be MCP Servers? Or are we best coding it a different way? I don't know enough about this to decide.

**Assistant:** Great architectural question! [Showed three options: Library approach, Shared helper MCP server, Use existing MCP via relay]

**User:** Lets generate the requirements with the question left open so the experts can guide us.

---

## MAD CP Library Conversations

**User:** we'll as part of the building of Rogers we'll need to build the MAD CP library. It would be added to relay and then we can conduct funcional tests.

[Discussion of MAD CP Protocol Library for message parsing]

**User:** well I guess there is the protocl, but there is also the interface, which is more what I mean. Each MAD and relay will need the MAD CP interface library to contribute to the conversation bus

**Assistant:** Ah, I see the distinction! [Explained Protocol Library vs Interface Library]

**User:** dont go too crazy with details for the requirements. There is the danger that you are going to start adding stuff that I dont intend. Our requirements should be incredibly short reflect just what I told you and we agreed upon.

**Assistant:** You're absolutely right - I'm over-engineering this. [Shortened approach]

**User:** [Later] its part of the requirements for the MAD CP CLient library

**User:** yes [to adding library retirement plan]

[Discussion of joshua_logger and joshua_network being replaced by conversation paradigm]

---

## Architecture & Scaffolding Conversation

**User:** I think the CP Librar and the MCP Server are parts of the Action Engine. But yes, lets do that requirement now, which again, keep very light. Dont answer questions that we have not answered

[Discussion of nested MAD components, inheritance vs composition, eMAD relationship to MAD]

---

## Dewey V1 Conversation

**User:** 4 is accurante. I dont know what capabilities he will need, but they should be DBA like. I imagine access to the Lake will be through the Conversation Bus? Not sure how that would work, but his v1 would have an imperator that could ask queries to.

**Assistant:** [Created requirements with open question about data access through conversation bus]

---

## Horace V1 Conversation

**User:** [In response to "What should Horace V1 look like?"] yes I think so [similar pattern to Dewey - Imperator for file questions]

**Assistant:** [Created requirements with similar open question about file operations through conversation bus]

---

## Marco V1 Conversation

**User:** yes, I think this will be one of the more complete v1 because the paraemters for what you can do with a browser are already well understood

**Assistant:** [Created requirements emphasizing Marco V1 could be more complete due to mature browser automation domain]

---

## Godot Retirement Conversation

**Assistant:** Since logs ARE conversations (tagged with #status, #error, #metric), and Rogers manages all conversations - does Godot: 1. Retire, 2. Transform, or 3. Stay?

**User:** Godot retires. Not much need for a logger if its part of the conversation bus

---

## Document MADs Conversation

**User:** we create sergey and so I think gates should be changed to be identical to sergey Except for Microsoft Doc and then we should use the existing Gates (renamed) for open source docs. Each needs an imperator that you can ask to create and manipulate docs

**Assistant:** Got it! [Showed three MADs: Sergey (Google), Gates (MS Office), New one (Open Source)]

**User:** no no, we already created Sergey, he deals with Google docs, Gates would deal with Microsoft Docs and a third that would deal with open source docs (needs a name)

**Assistant:** Ah, got it! Name suggestions: Stallman, Torvalds, Raymond

**User:** Stallman is fine

**User:** Actually in keeping with the way the names work, V1 sergey should be cahnged to V1 Brin when we build it. Keep it in the same place, dont create a directory now, just put in the requirments

**Assistant:** [Renamed Sergey to Brin - after Sergey Brin, Google co-founder]

---

## Playfair V1 Conversation

**User:** [In response to "Should Playfair V1 be similar pattern?"] yes

**Assistant:** [Created requirements for conversational diagram creation]

---

## Hopper V1 Conversation

**User:** yes, so the way it would work is you would engage the imperator and say, hey I want to build something or hey I want to update XYZ. He's goign to say something sure think tell me a bit about it -- ok so let me get your Project Manager - PM does things like creating the Git project items, adding git issues. You could say to the PM, hey lets clean up some Git ISsues or I need to build a New MAD. The PM would guide you through planning, creating docs etc. When creating docs he'd spin up a consutling team with the appropriate members. And control their process the way I have been doing with you, but also what you have been doing for the Trio. Once you got to deployment and testing he'd lead them trought that. He'd post the files, update GIT, rate teh performance, but generate none of the product.

**Assistant:** [Created detailed requirements showing PM-led workflow, PM coordinates but doesn't generate code, spins up dev teams]

---

## Security MADs Conversation

**User:** I think Sentinel (needs better name) is a one stop shop for all things security that can spin up a variety of eMAD teams and may have persisent functions within it

**Assistant:** [Showed Sentinel capabilities, asked for name suggestions]

**User:** Ill figure out the name, we just need to figure out what he does. I think you are right about that. That leaves the question of secrets I think, which really is separate from security i think. That can be Turing

**Assistant:** Perfect separation! [Showed Sentinel for security, Turing for secrets]

**User:** McNamara

**Assistant:** McNamara - perfect! (Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense)

**User:** nope Ed McNamara famous police chief

**Assistant:** Even better! Ed McNamara, famous police chief - perfect for security.

**User:** It think it would have those things eventually, the question is how much to put in v1.

**Assistant:** [Showed minimal but functional V1: Imperator, basic monitoring, eMAD coordination]

**User:** yeah I think so

---

## Early Integration Test Conversation

**User:** one of the early itegration we can execut on is to ask Marco to provide an updated LLM list for Fielder

**Assistant:** Excellent early integration test! [Showed conversation flow: User→Fiedler→Marco→research→Fiedler updates]

**User:** fiedler uses and manages his list

**Assistant:** Got it - Fiedler maintains his own LLM list/database, Marco just provides the research.

---

## Solomon & Wright Retirement Conversation

**User:** Most of the testing I think happens with hopper, but I was thinking perhaps that there was a larger testing sitution that Solomon was needed for, but now with the concept of emads, I dont think its needed. You could for example have hopper spint up a load testing or security testing team that persists after the desing and implementation team have been turned off.

**Assistant:** Excellent point! With eMADs, Solomon becomes unnecessary - testing is just another eMAD role.

**User:** same thing with Wright, I think you just do that in hopper with a differnt kind of team

**Assistant:** Wright retired too! Architecture/design is consulting eMAD role.

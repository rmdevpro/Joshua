# Verification Commands Reference

## Enhanced Tool - Auto-compile from File List

The send_to_triplets.py tool now auto-compiles packages from file lists, eliminating the need for manual bash script package creation.

### Full v4 Verification (All 10 Papers)

```bash
cd /mnt/projects/ICCM/tools

python send_to_triplets.py \
    --files \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/CET_Architecture_Clarification_Summary.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/01_ICCM_Primary_Paper_v4.1.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/02_Progressive_Training_Methodology_v4.1.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/03_CET_Architecture_Specialization_v4.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/04B_Production_Learning_Pipeline_v4.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/05_CET_D_Requirements_Engineering_Implementation_v4.1.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/07A_Self_Bootstrapping_Development_v4.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/07B_Continuous_Self_Improvement_v4.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/11_Testing_Infrastructure_v4.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/13_Bidirectional_Processing_v4.md \
        /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/14_Edge_CET_P_v4.md \
    --output-dir /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/v4_verifications \
    --prompt "Please verify these 10 corrected v4 papers for architectural consistency. Confirm: 1) CETs generate ONLY context 2) LLMs generate ALL outputs 3) Method/class names reflect context engineering role. Report any remaining issues."
```

### Monitor Progress

In a separate terminal:
```bash
tail -f /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/v4_verifications/verification_progress.log
```

## Previous Method (Pre-compiled Package)

Still supported for backward compatibility:

```bash
python send_to_triplets.py \
    /tmp/iccm_complete_v4_verification_package.md \
    /mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/v4_verifications
```

## Status: All Three Models Working ✅

All three AI models are now fully operational:

- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: ✅ Working
- **GPT-4o**: ✅ Working (using openai_chat_review.py)
- **Grok 4**: ✅ Working (using grok_client.py with OpenAI SDK)

### Previous v4 Verification Results

**Gemini 2.5 Pro** successfully verified all 10 v4 papers as "Fully Consistent" with CET architecture (42.3s):
- All papers correctly implement: CETs generate ONLY context
- All generation/modification attributed to LLMs
- Method/class names accurately reflect context engineering roles
- No remaining architectural issues found

## Output Files

After successful verification, the tool creates:
- `/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/v4_verifications/Gemini_2.5_Pro_Verification.md` ✅
- `/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/v4_verifications/GPT-5_Verification.md` ✅
- `/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/v4_verifications/Grok_4_Verification.md` ✅
- `/mnt/projects/ICCM/docs/papers/v4_verifications/verification_progress.log`

## Technical Notes

**Python Environment:** All three clients now use `/mnt/projects/gemini-tool/venv/bin/python` with openai package installed

**Client Scripts:**
- Gemini: `gemini_client.py` (uses requests library)
- GPT-4o: `openai_chat_review.py` (uses OpenAI SDK)
- Grok: `grok_client.py` (uses OpenAI SDK with xAI endpoint)

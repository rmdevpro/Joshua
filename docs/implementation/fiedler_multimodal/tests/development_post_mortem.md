## Issue Analysis

### Critical Issues Identified: 2

1. **Missing URL Redirect Success Test** (Iteration 1)
   - Reported by: DeepSeek
   - Severity: CRITICAL
   - Resolution: Added `test_resolve_url_redirect_success`
   - Iterations to fix: 1

2. **Missing Empty Base64 Test** (Iteration 1)
   - Reported by: DeepSeek
   - Severity: CRITICAL  
   - Resolution: Added `test_resolve_empty_base64`
   - Iterations to fix: 1

### Drift Incidents: 1

1. **Scope Drift - Out-of-Requirements Features** (Iteration 1)
   - Description: GPT-4o requested tests for async processing, "reference" type, provider-specific validation
   - Detection: Driver flagged drift (Yellow 3/5)
   - Resolution: Senior Member correctly rejected as out-of-scope with clear rationale
   - Impact: Minimal - Did not delay cycle

### Circular Changes Detected: 0

### Out-of-Scope Rejections: 4

1. **Provider-Specific Testing** (Iteration 1)
   - Requested by: GPT-4o, DeepSeek (nice-to-have)
   - Rejected by: Senior Member (Gemini)
   - Rationale: Belongs in integration tests per requirements v1.3 §2.5.1
   - Driver validation: ✅ Correct

2. **Async Processing Tests** (Iteration 1)
   - Requested by: GPT-4o
   - Rejected by: Senior Member (Gemini)
   - Rationale: Separate component per requirements v1.3 §2.4
   - Driver validation: ✅ Correct

3. **Attachment "Reference" Type** (Iteration 1)
   - Requested by: GPT-4o
   - Rejected by: Senior Member (Gemini)
   - Rationale: Different resolution mechanism, not in scope
   - Driver validation: ✅ Correct

4. **IPv6 SSRF Deferral** (Iteration 1)
   - Requested by: GPT-4o
   - Rejected by: Senior Member (Gemini)
   - Rationale: Tests match implementation, requirement defers but code includes basic IPv6
   - Driver validation: ✅ Correct

**Areas for Improvement**:
- None identified

**Overall Rating**: 5/5

### Junior Member 1 (GPT-4o)

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive system-level thinking
- Identified potential future concerns
- Approved when issues resolved

**Areas for Improvement**:
- Some scope drift in Round 1 (flagged async, reference type not in v1.3)
- Mixed in-scope and out-of-scope issues

**Overall Rating**: 4/5

### Junior Member 2 (DeepSeek)

**Strengths**:
- Laser-focused on requirements v1.3
- Identified critical gaps (URL redirect, empty base64)
- Clear, actionable feedback
- Excellent drift detection

**Areas for Improvement**:
- None identified

**Overall Rating**: 5/5

### Team Dynamics

- **Best collaboration**: DeepSeeks focused feedback enabled quick resolution

**Critical Architecture Statement from Code (Round 3-4):**
> "As the Senior Member, I acknowledge the critical architectural flaw in the previous design.
> The use of a separate microservice for sequential thinking violates our core MAD principles,
> introduces a bottleneck, and adds unnecessary complexity. This was an oversight, and I take
> full responsibility for correcting it immediately.
>
> The following revised implementation embeds the sequential thinking capability directly within
> each Imperator's Thought Engine, making each MAD truly self-contained and scalable."

## Critical Architecture Notes

**4-SERVICE ARCHITECTURE (FINAL)**

The approved V1 MAD Group architecture has **4 services ONLY**:

1. **Redis** - Message broker (Pub/Sub transport layer)
2. **Grace V0** - MCP ↔ Bus relay (partial MAD, Action Engine only)
3. **Fiedler V1** - Conversational orchestrator (full MAD with Imperator + embedded Sequential Thinking)
4. **Rogers V1** - Intelligent conversation bus (full MAD with Imperator + embedded Sequential Thinking)

**Sequential Thinking is NOT a separate service.**

It is embedded directly in the Imperators of Fiedler and Rogers as an internal capability using OpenAI API calls for complex reasoning tasks.

## Change History

### 2025-10-11: Major Architectural Corrections

**Problem Identified:**
- Round 2 Design (v2.1) incorrectly specified Sequential Thinking as 5th separate microservice
- Round 5 Implementation Plan incorrectly included Step 3 "Deploy Sequential Thinking Service"
- Both contradicted Round 3-4 approved code which embeds Sequential Thinking in Imperators

**Root Cause:**
- Design v2.1 was approved before code implementation revealed the architectural flaw
- Implementation Plan (Round 5) was generated from Design v2.1, inheriting the error
- Approved code (Round 3-4) correctly rejected separate Sequential Thinking service

**Resolution:**
- **Design Document:** Gemini 2.5 Pro corrected v2.1 → v2.2 (correlation 9e25d6e9, 2025-10-11 14:11)
  - Removed all 18 references to Sequential Thinking as separate service
  - Changed architecture from 5 to 4 services
  - Updated all diagrams and deployment specifications

- **Implementation Plan:** Gemini 2.5 Pro corrected (correlation 22fd2cee, 2025-10-11 14:00)
  - Removed Step 3 "Deploy Sequential Thinking Service"
  - Changed from 5 to 4 services throughout
  - Updated startup sequence and verification steps

**Verification:**
- All documents now align with approved code (Round 3-4)
- All documents consistently specify 4-service architecture
- Sequential Thinking correctly described as embedded Imperator capability

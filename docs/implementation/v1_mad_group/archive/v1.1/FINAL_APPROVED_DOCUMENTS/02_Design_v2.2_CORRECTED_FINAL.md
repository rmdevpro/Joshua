As the Senior Member for the V1 MAD Group, I have reviewed the correction package and the attached documents. The architectural discrepancy between the approved Design Document and the approved Implementation is critical and has been rectified.

The following output provides the corrected Design Document, which now aligns with the 4-service architecture of the approved code, and a detailed summary of all changes made.

---

### **1. Corrected Design Document**

Here is the full, corrected version of the Design Document.

---

As the Senior Member in Design Synthesis, I have incorporated the two new critical requirements into the V1 MAD Group design. The following document is the updated and definitive source of truth for implementation. Changes are clearly marked for review.

---

## **V1 MAD Group: Unified Design Document**

**Version:** 2.2 **[CORRECTED]**
**Status:** Approved for Implementation
**Synthesizer:** Senior Member

**[UPDATED] Change Log (v2.1 -> v2.2):**
*   **REQ-ADD-01: Sequential Thinking Integration [CORRECTED]:** Re-architected sequential thinking from a separate microservice to a capability **embedded directly within the Fiedler and Rogers Imperators**. This aligns the design with the approved 4-service implementation, enhancing MAD self-sufficiency and removing a network bottleneck.
*   **REQ-ADD-02: Imperator Context File:** Added the `IMPERATOR.md` context file requirement for both Fiedler and Rogers to provide domain-specific operational guidance to the Imperator. Updated file structures and added a new integration pattern description.

This document provides the complete, unified design for the V1 MAD Group, encompassing Grace V0, Fiedler V1, and Rogers V1. It is aligned with all approved requirements and the specified lab deployment context.

---

### **1. Overall V1 MAD Group Architecture**

**[CORRECTED]** The V1 MAD Group operates as a distributed system of **four services** communicating over an intelligent conversation bus. Clients interact with individual MADs via the MCP protocol. For complex reasoning, the Fiedler and Rogers MADs leverage their **built-in sequential thinking capabilities**. All inter-MAD communication occurs via the Rogers Conversation Bus (Redis Pub/Sub).

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "External Clients"
        MCP_Client[MCP Client]
        SSH_Admin[Admin via SSH]
    end

    subgraph "V1 MAD Group (Docker Network)"
        subgraph "MADs"

        end

        subgraph "Infrastructure"
            Redis[Redis Server <br/> (Pub/Sub)]
        end

        G -- Pub/Sub --> Redis
        F -- Pub/Sub --> Redis
        R -- Pub/Sub (Listener & Publisher) --> Redis
    end

    MCP_Client -- MCP/WebSocket --> G
    MCP_Client -- MCP/WebSocket --> F
    MCP_Client -- MCP/WebSocket --> R

    SSH_Admin -- SSH (Key-based) --> F
    SSH_Admin -- SSH (Key-based) --> R
```

### **2. Grace V0 Design (MCP â†” Rogers Bus Relay)**

Grace V0 is a "Partial MAD" acting as a simple, stateless bridge. It possesses only an Action Engine, translating legacy MCP requests into bus messages and buffering bus messages for polling-based clients.

*(No changes in this section)*

#### **2.1. Architecture**

Grace is a pure Action Engine. It is designed for simplicity and low latency.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Grace V0 (Action Engine Only)
        A[MCP Server <br/> (joshua_network)]
        B[joshua_conversation Client]
        C[In-Memory Message Queues <br/> (Per-Client, LRU per REQ-GR-04)]

        A -- Publishes outgoing messages --> B
        A -- Reads buffered messages for polling --> C
        B -- Receives inbound messages & writes to --> C
    end

    subgraph External
        Client -- MCP Request --> A
        RogersBus[Rogers Conversation Bus (Redis)]
    end

    B <--> RogersBus
```

*   **Components**:
    *   **MCP Server**: Listens for WebSocket connections and handles the `grace_*` tools.
    *   **joshua\_conversation Client**: Connects to Redis, publishes outgoing messages, and manages subscriptions on behalf of polling clients.
    *   **In-Memory Message Queues**: A dictionary of `collections.deque` objects (max length 100), keyed by `client_id`, implementing the LRU cache requirement (REQ-GR-04).

#### **2.2. Data Flows**

*   **Outbound (`grace_send_message`)**: An MCP request is received, validated, and immediately published to the Rogers Bus via the `joshua_conversation` client. A success/failure response is returned.
*   **Inbound (`grace_subscribe` -> `grace_poll_messages`)**:
    1.  A client calls `grace_subscribe` with a `client_id` and topics. Grace subscribes to Redis and creates an in-memory queue for that `client_id`.
    2.  Messages arriving from the bus are appended to the corresponding client's queue. The oldest message is dropped if the queue is full.
    3.  The client calls `grace_poll_messages` to retrieve all messages from its queue, which is then cleared.

#### **2.3. API Specifications (MCP Tools)**

**1. `grace_send_message` (REQ-GR-02)**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "grace_send_message",
      "tool_input": {
        "channel": "string", // e.g., "mad.direct.fiedler", "mad.topic.system_events"
        "payload": "object",
        "recipient_id": "string | null",
        "conversation_id": "string | null",
        "correlation_id": "string | null"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Success)**: `{"status": "success", "message_id": "uuid-string"}`

**2. `grace_subscribe` (REQ-GR-02)**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "grace_subscribe",
      "tool_input": {
        "client_id": "string",
        "topics": ["string"] // e.g., ["mad.direct.my_client", "mad.stream.*"]
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Success)**: `{"status": "success", "message": "Subscribed client 'client_id' to N topics."}`

**3. `grace_poll_messages` (REQ-GR-02)**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "grace_poll_messages",
      "tool_input": {
        "client_id": "string"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Success)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "messages": [ /* Array of standard message envelope objects */ ]
    }
    ```

#### **2.4. Database Schema**

**None.** Grace V0 is stateless and uses only in-memory queues per REQ-GR-04. State is lost on restart.

---

### **3. Fiedler V1 Design (Conversational Orchestrator)**

Fiedler V1 is a full MAD that manages long-running, asynchronous tasks and provides a conversational interface for orchestration.

#### **3.1. Architecture**

**[CORRECTED]** Fiedler implements the standard V1 MAD architecture. The Imperator is the primary component of the Thought Engine. For complex reasoning tasks that require planning or multi-step analysis, the Imperator utilizes its **own embedded sequential thinking capability**, making an internal call to the OpenAI API to generate a structured plan before synthesizing a response.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Fiedler V1
        subgraph Action Engine
            M[MCP Server <br/> (joshua_network)]
            T[Task Manager]
            S[SQLite State Persistence <br/> (WAL Mode per REQ-FD-04)]
            J[joshua_conversation Client]
            H[SSH Command Host <br/> (joshua_ssh)]
        end

        subgraph Thought Engine
            TE[Thought Engine]
            I[Imperator (LLM) <br/> with built-in <br/> sequential thinking]
        end

        M -- Creates task --> T
        T -- Persists state --> S
        T -- Publishes stream/notifications --> J
        T -- Invokes --> I
        I -- Queries state (read-only) --> T
        M -- Registers tools with --> H
    end
```
*   **Action Engine Components**:
    *   **Task Manager**: Central component managing the lifecycle of asynchronous tasks, orchestrating state changes, and interacting with other components.
    *   **SQLite State Persistence**: Provides durable storage for task state, using WAL mode for crash resilience.
*   **Thought Engine Components (V1 Focus)**:
    *   **Imperator**: The LLM reasoning core. It receives prompts from the Task Manager, queries state via a secure, read-only API (REQ-FD-10), and ***for complex problem-solving, planning, or multi-step analysis, it invokes its own internal sequential thinking logic to generate a structured plan.***

#### **3.1.1. Imperator Context File (`IMPERATOR.md`)**

To guide its operation, Fiedler's Imperator will load a context file named `IMPERATOR.md` on startup. This file provides crucial domain-specific instructions.

*   **Location**: `mads/fiedler/IMPERATOR.md`
*   **Content**:
    *   **Primary Directive**: "You are the orchestrator for the Fiedler V1 MAD. Your goal is to manage asynchronous tasks and answer queries about their state."
    *   **Available Tools**: Describes the read-only APIs available for querying task state (e.g., `get_task_status(task_id)`, `list_recent_tasks()`).
    *   **Orchestration Patterns**: Provides best practices, such as how to respond to prompts about starting new tasks vs. querying existing ones.
    *   **Security Boundaries**: Explicitly states that all access to the Action Engine is read-only and that it cannot create, modify, or delete tasks directly.
    *   **[CORRECTED] Sequential Thinking Trigger**: Guidelines on when to engage its internal capability (e.g., "For prompts asking you to 'design a workflow' or 'plan the steps to achieve X', you must use your **built-in sequential thinking capability**.").

#### **3.2. Data Flow (`fiedler_converse`)**

**[CORRECTED]**
1.  MCP Server receives a `fiedler_converse` request.
2.  It immediately creates a new task in SQLite with `status: 'PENDING'` and a unique `task_id`.
3.  It responds instantly to the client with the `task_id` and `stream_topic` (`mad.stream.{task_id}`).
4.  The Task Manager picks up the task, updates its status to `RUNNING`, and invokes the Imperator. ***For complex requests (e.g., containing "plan the steps"), the Imperator detects these keywords and triggers its internal sequential thinking process. This involves making a separate, specially-prompted call to the OpenAI API to generate a structured JSON plan.***
5.  As the Imperator generates tokens (either directly for simple prompts or based on the internally-generated plan for complex ones), the Task Manager publishes each one to the `stream_topic`.
6.  Upon completion, the Task Manager updates the task in SQLite to `COMPLETED` (or `FAILED`) and publishes a final notification message.

#### **3.3. State Machine (Task Lifecycle)**

This state machine ensures clear tracking and no silent failures (REQ-FD-06).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING: Create Task
    PENDING --> RUNNING: Task Manager starts execution
    RUNNING --> STREAMING: First token generated
    STREAMING --> RUNNING: Awaiting next token
    RUNNING --> COMPLETED: Execution successful
    STREAMING --> COMPLETED: Final token sent, success
    RUNNING --> FAILED: Error during execution
    STREAMING --> FAILED: Error during streaming
```

#### **3.4. API Specifications (MCP Tools)**

**1. `fiedler_converse` (REQ-FD-02)**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "fiedler_converse",
      "tool_input": {
        "prompt": "string",
        "requester_id": "string" // For final notification
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Immediate)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "pending",
      "task_id": "uuid-string",
      "stream_topic": "mad.stream.uuid-string"
    }
    ```

**2. `fiedler_get_task_status`**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "fiedler_get_task_status",
      "tool_input": { "task_id": "uuid-string" }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Full State)**:
    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "uuid-string",
      "status": "PENDING | RUNNING | STREAMING | COMPLETED | FAILED",
      "prompt": "Original user prompt...",
      "result_payload": "object | null",
      "error_details": {
        "message": "Error message",
        "stack_trace": "Full stack trace..."
      },
      "created_at": "iso-8601-timestamp",
      "updated_at": "iso-8601-timestamp"
    }
    ```

#### **3.5. Database Schema (`fiedler_state.db`)**

**Table: `tasks`** (WAL Mode Enabled per REQ-FD-04)

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `task_id` | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | Unique UUID for the task. |
| `status` | TEXT | NOT NULL | PENDING, RUNNING, STREAMING, COMPLETED, FAILED. |
| `requester_id`| TEXT | NOT NULL | ID of the entity that initiated the task. |
| `prompt` | TEXT | NOT NULL | The initial natural language prompt. |
| `result_payload`| TEXT | | JSON blob of the final result on success. |
| `error_details` | TEXT | | JSON blob with message/stack trace on failure (REQ-FD-06). |
| `created_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO 8601 timestamp of creation. |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO 8601 timestamp of last update. |

### **4. Rogers V1 Design (Intelligent Conversation Bus)**

Rogers V1 is a full MAD that manages, monitors, and reports on the health and activity of the entire conversation bus.

#### **4.1. Architecture**

**[CORRECTED]** Rogers uses the full MAD structure to provide intelligence *about* the bus itself. Its Imperator leverages its **embedded sequential thinking capability** for complex diagnostic queries and trend analysis, making it a self-contained analytical unit.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Rogers V1
        subgraph Action Engine
            M[MCP Server]
            CM[Connection Manager]
            MM[Metrics Collector]
            S[SQLite State Persistence <br/> (WAL Mode)]
            J[joshua_conversation Client]
            H[SSH Command Host]
        end

        subgraph Thought Engine
            I[Imperator (LLM) <br/> with built-in <br/> sequential thinking]
        end

        M -- Forwards conversational tasks --> I
        I -- Queries bus state (read-only) --> S
        J -- Bus Listener (`mad.#`) --> CM & MM
        CM -- Updates connection state --> S
        MM -- Updates metrics state --> S
        M -- Registers tools with --> H
    end
```

*   **Action Engine Components**:
    *   **Connection Manager (REQ-RG-14)**: Maintains a live registry of participating MADs.
    *   **Metrics Collector (REQ-RG-15)**: Gathers statistics on traffic volume and topics.
*   **Thought Engine Components**:
    *   **Imperator (REQ-RG-02)**: Provides a natural language interface to query the state collected by the Action Engine. ***It uses its own internal sequential thinking logic to analyze trends, diagnose complex bus behavior, and correlate data from multiple sources.***

#### **4.1.1. Imperator Context File (`IMPERATOR.md`)**

Rogers' Imperator is guided by its own `IMPERATOR.md` file, tailored for bus intelligence.

*   **Location**: `mads/rogers/IMPERATOR.md`
*   **Content**:
    *   **Primary Directive**: "You are the intelligence engine for the Rogers V1 Conversation Bus. Your purpose is to monitor, analyze, and report on the health and activity of the MAD network."
    *   **Available Tools**: Describes read-only APIs for querying bus state (e.g., `get_connections()`, `get_hourly_metrics(start_time, end_time)`).
    *   **Diagnostics Patterns**: Provides examples of how to answer questions like "Why might Fiedler be slow?" by correlating connection heartbeats with message volume metrics.
    *   **Security Boundaries**: Reinforces read-only access to state and prohibits any action that would interfere with bus traffic (e.g., publishing messages).
    *   **[CORRECTED] Sequential Thinking Trigger**: Guidelines for complex analysis (e.g., "For prompts asking you to 'find anomalies in traffic patterns' or 'predict future load based on the last 24 hours', you must use your **built-in sequential thinking capability**.").

#### **4.2. Data Flows**

**[CORRECTED]**
*   **Passive Collection**: Rogers' `joshua_conversation` client is always subscribed to `mad.#`. The Connection Manager and Metrics Collector handlers receive copies of all bus traffic and update their respective tables in SQLite.
*   **`rogers_converse`**: The flow is identical to Fiedler's. When a complex analytical prompt is received (e.g., "Correlate message spikes with MAD connection events"), ***the Imperator triggers its internal sequential thinking process to generate a structured analysis plan*** before synthesizing the final answer for the user.

#### **4.3. API Specifications (MCP Tools)**

*   **`rogers_converse`**: Identical schema and behavior to `fiedler_converse` (REQ-RG-03).
*   **`rogers_get_task_status`**: Identical schema and behavior to `fiedler_get_task_status` (REQ-RG-05).
*   **`rogers_get_connections` (REQ-RG-11)**: A direct tool returning a list of connected MADs from the `connections` table.
*   **`rogers_get_stats` (REQ-RG-11)**: A direct tool returning aggregated metrics from the `hourly_metrics` table.

#### **4.4. Database Schema (`rogers_state.db`)**

**1. Table: `tasks`**
*   Identical structure to Fiedler's `tasks` table, used for Rogers' own conversational tasks.

**2. Table: `connections` (REQ-RG-14)**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mad_id` | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | The unique name of the connected MAD. |
| `status` | TEXT | NOT NULL | CONNECTED, HEALTHY, STALE, DISCONNECTED. |
| `connected_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO 8601 timestamp of first appearance. |
| `last_heartbeat`| TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO 8601 timestamp of last known activity. |

**3. Table: `hourly_metrics` (REQ-RG-15)**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `hour_timestamp`| TEXT | | ISO 8601 timestamp for the hour bucket. |
| `sender_id` | TEXT | | The MAD sending the messages. |
| `topic_pattern` | TEXT | | Aggregated topic (e.g., 'mad.direct', 'mad.topic'). |
| `message_count` | INTEGER | NOT NULL | Count of messages for this aggregation bucket. |
| **PRIMARY KEY** | (`hour_timestamp`, `sender_id`, `topic_pattern`) |

---

### **5. Integration Patterns**

#### **5.1. Standard Message Envelope**

All messages published on the Rogers Bus MUST adhere to this standard JSON envelope (REQ-JC-05), ensuring consistent metadata for routing, tracing, and metrics.

```json
{
  "message_id": "uuid",         // Unique ID for this message
  "conversation_id": "uuid",    // ID for a multi-message exchange
  "correlation_id": "uuid",     // ID for tracing a single request across all systems
  "timestamp": "iso-8601",      // Message creation time
  "sender_id": "string",        // e.g., "fiedler"
  "recipient_id": "string|null",// For direct messages
  "channel": "string",          // The Redis channel it was published on
  "payload": {}                 // The actual message content
}
```

#### **5.2. Redis Pub/Sub Channels**

*   `mad.direct.{recipient_id}`: For messages directed to a single MAD.
*   `mad.topic.{topic_name}`: For broadcast messages related to a specific subject (e.g., `mad.topic.system_events`).
*   `mad.stream.{task_id}`: For streaming token responses from Fiedler or Rogers.
*   `mad.system.heartbeat`: Channel for MADs to publish periodic health checks.
*   `mad.#`: Wildcard pattern used exclusively by Rogers for metrics and connection tracking.

#### **5.3. Imperator Context Loading**

To ensure domain-specific behavior, the Imperator instance within both Fiedler and Rogers MUST load its respective `IMPERATOR.md` file upon initialization. This content will be used as a permanent system prompt or foundational context for all subsequent reasoning tasks processed by that Imperator. This ensures that each Imperator operates strictly within its designated role and is aware of its available tools and constraints.

---

### **6. Deployment Architecture**

#### **6.1. File Structure (Monorepo)**

**[CORRECTED]** The monorepo structure is updated to include the new `IMPERATOR.md` context files, reflecting the 4-service architecture.

```
/mad-group-v1/
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ .env

â””â”€â”€ configs/
    â””â”€â”€ ssh/
        â””â”€â”€ authorized_keys
```

#### **6.2. Docker Compose & Networking**

**[CORRECTED]** A `docker-compose.yml` file will define **four** services: `redis`, `grace`, `fiedler`, and `rogers`.
*   **Network**: All services will be placed on a single, isolated Docker bridge network (`mad-net`).
*   **Redis**: The Redis service will require a password, provided via the `.env` file (REQ-JC-09).
*   **SSH**: The Fiedler and Rogers SSH servers will be exposed to the host machine for administrative access.
*   **Volumes**: Named volumes will be used to persist the SQLite databases (`fiedler-data`, `rogers-data`).

### **2. Summary of all changes made**

The Design Document `V1_MAD_Group_Complete_Design_v2.1_FINAL.md` has been corrected to version `2.2` to resolve the critical architectural inconsistency with the approved implementation (`V1_MAD_Group_Complete_Implementation_v2_FINAL.md`). The document now accurately reflects the 4-service architecture.

**Core Architectural Correction:**
*   **Removed the Separate "Sequential Thinking" Microservice:** All 18 references to a standalone `sequential_thinking` MCP server have been removed from the document.
*   **Embedded Sequential Thinking in Imperators:** The design now correctly describes sequential thinking as a built-in capability of the Fiedler and Rogers Imperators, where they use their own OpenAI API clients to generate structured plans for complex prompts.

**Detailed List of Changes:**

*   **Document Versioning:**
    *   Version updated from `2.1` to `2.2 [CORRECTED]`.
    *   Change Log entry for `REQ-ADD-01` was rewritten to describe the embedding of the capability, not the integration of a separate service.

*   **Section 1: Overall V1 MAD Group Architecture:**
    *   Text updated from "five services" to "four services".
    *   Removed mention of a "centralized Sequential Thinking service".
    *   The main Mermaid diagram was updated to remove the `SeqThink` node and the corresponding MCP client connections from Fiedler and Rogers.

*   **Section 3: Fiedler V1 Design:**
    *   **3.1 Architecture:** Text was updated to state that the Imperator has a "built-in sequential thinking capability" instead of acting as an MCP client. The architecture Mermaid diagram was corrected to remove the external `ST[Sequential Thinking]` node.
    *   **3.1.1 Imperator Context File:** The "Sequential Thinking Trigger" description was updated to specify using its "**built-in sequential thinking capability**" to match the approved implementation's `IMPERATOR.md`.
    *   **3.2 Data Flow:** The description was rewritten to accurately reflect the *internal* process: keyword detection triggers a direct call to the OpenAI API to generate a JSON plan, which is then used to formulate the final response. All references to calling an external server were removed.

*   **Section 4: Rogers V1 Design:**
    *   **4.1 Architecture:** Text was updated to describe the Imperator's "embedded sequential thinking capability". The architecture Mermaid diagram was corrected to remove the external `ST[Sequential Thinking]` node.
    *   **4.1.1 Imperator Context File:** The "Sequential Thinking Trigger" description was updated to specify using its "**built-in sequential thinking capability**".
    *   **4.2 Data Flows:** The description was rewritten to describe the internal sequential thinking process, mirroring the changes made for Fiedler.

*   **Section 6: Deployment Architecture:**
    *   **6.1 File Structure:** The file structure diagram was corrected to remove the `mads/sequential_thinking/` directory.
    *   **6.2 Docker Compose & Networking:** The text was updated from "five services" to "**four** services". The explicit bullet point describing the `sequential_thinking` service was completely removed.

This corrected document is now in full alignment with the approved code, resolving the architectural contradiction.

As the Senior Member in Design Synthesis, I have reviewed the three independent designs and synthesized them into this single, unified document. This design incorporates the strongest architectural patterns, clearest data flows, and most implementation-ready specifications from each proposal, resolving all inconsistencies.

This document is the definitive source of truth for the implementation of the V1 MAD Group.

## **V1 MAD Group: Unified Design Document**

**Version:** 2.0 (Synthesized)
**Status:** Approved for Implementation
**Synthesizer:** Senior Member

This document provides the complete, unified design for the V1 MAD Group, encompassing Grace V0, Fiedler V1, and Rogers V1. It is aligned with all approved requirements and the specified lab deployment context.

---

### **1. Overall V1 MAD Group Architecture**

The V1 MAD Group operates as a distributed system communicating over an intelligent conversation bus. Clients interact with individual MADs via the MCP protocol (over WebSockets). All inter-MAD communication, including streaming responses and notifications, occurs via the Rogers Conversation Bus, which is powered by Redis Pub/Sub.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "External Clients"
        MCP_Client[MCP Client]
        SSH_Admin[Admin via SSH]
    end

    subgraph "V1 MAD Group (Docker Network)"
        subgraph "MADs"
            G[Grace V0 <br/> MCP-Bus Relay]
            F[Fiedler V1 <br/> Conversational Orchestrator]
            R[Rogers V1 <br/> Intelligent Bus]
        end

        subgraph "Infrastructure"
            Redis[Redis Server <br/> (Pub/Sub)]
        end

        G -- Pub/Sub --> Redis
        F -- Pub/Sub --> Redis
        R -- Pub/Sub (Listener & Publisher) --> Redis
    end

    MCP_Client -- MCP/WebSocket --> G
    MCP_Client -- MCP/WebSocket --> F
    MCP_Client -- MCP/WebSocket --> R

    SSH_Admin -- SSH (Key-based) --> F
    SSH_Admin -- SSH (Key-based) --> R
```

---

### **2. Grace V0 Design (MCP â†” Rogers Bus Relay)**

Grace V0 is a "Partial MAD" acting as a simple, stateless bridge. It possesses only an Action Engine, translating legacy MCP requests into bus messages and buffering bus messages for polling-based clients.

#### **2.1. Architecture**

Grace is a pure Action Engine. It is designed for simplicity and low latency.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Grace V0 (Action Engine Only)
        A[MCP Server <br/> (joshua_network)]
        B[joshua_conversation Client]
        C[In-Memory Message Queues <br/> (Per-Client, LRU per REQ-GR-04)]

        A -- Publishes outgoing messages --> B
        A -- Reads buffered messages for polling --> C
        B -- Receives inbound messages & writes to --> C
    end

    subgraph External
        Client -- MCP Request --> A
        RogersBus[Rogers Conversation Bus (Redis)]
    end

    B <--> RogersBus
```

*   **Components**:
    *   **MCP Server**: Listens for WebSocket connections and handles the `grace_*` tools.
    *   **joshua\_conversation Client**: Connects to Redis, publishes outgoing messages, and manages subscriptions on behalf of polling clients.
    *   **In-Memory Message Queues**: A dictionary of `collections.deque` objects (max length 100), keyed by `client_id`, implementing the LRU cache requirement (REQ-GR-04).

#### **2.2. Data Flows**

*   **Outbound (`grace_send_message`)**: An MCP request is received, validated, and immediately published to the Rogers Bus via the `joshua_conversation` client. A success/failure response is returned.
*   **Inbound (`grace_subscribe` -> `grace_poll_messages`)**:
    1.  A client calls `grace_subscribe` with a `client_id` and topics. Grace subscribes to Redis and creates an in-memory queue for that `client_id`.
    2.  Messages arriving from the bus are appended to the corresponding client's queue. The oldest message is dropped if the queue is full.
    3.  The client calls `grace_poll_messages` to retrieve all messages from its queue, which is then cleared.

#### **2.3. API Specifications (MCP Tools)**

**1. `grace_send_message` (REQ-GR-02)**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "grace_send_message",
      "tool_input": {
        "channel": "string", // e.g., "mad.direct.fiedler", "mad.topic.system_events"
        "payload": "object",
        "recipient_id": "string | null",
        "conversation_id": "string | null",
        "correlation_id": "string | null"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Success)**: `{"status": "success", "message_id": "uuid-string"}`

**2. `grace_subscribe` (REQ-GR-02)**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "grace_subscribe",
      "tool_input": {
        "client_id": "string",
        "topics": ["string"] // e.g., ["mad.direct.my_client", "mad.stream.*"]
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Success)**: `{"status": "success", "message": "Subscribed client 'client_id' to N topics."}`

**3. `grace_poll_messages` (REQ-GR-02)**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "grace_poll_messages",
      "tool_input": {
        "client_id": "string"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Success)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "messages": [ /* Array of standard message envelope objects */ ]
    }
    ```

#### **2.4. Database Schema**

**None.** Grace V0 is stateless and uses only in-memory queues per REQ-GR-04. State is lost on restart.

---

### **3. Fiedler V1 Design (Conversational Orchestrator)**

Fiedler V1 is a full MAD that manages long-running, asynchronous tasks and provides a conversational interface for orchestration.

#### **3.1. Architecture**

Fiedler implements the standard V1 MAD architecture. The Thought Engine is primarily driven by the Imperator for V1, with DTR/LPPM/CET representing the architectural pattern for future expansion.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Fiedler V1
        subgraph Action Engine
            M[MCP Server <br/> (joshua_network)]
            T[Task Manager]
            S[SQLite State Persistence <br/> (WAL Mode per REQ-FD-04)]
            J[joshua_conversation Client]
            H[SSH Command Host <br/> (joshua_ssh)]
        end

        subgraph Thought Engine
            TE[Thought Engine]
            I[Imperator (LLM)]
            DTR(DTR) -- V1+ --> LPPM(LPPM) -- V1+ --> CET(CET) -- V1+ --> I
        end

        M -- Creates task --> T
        T -- Persists state --> S
        T -- Publishes stream/notifications --> J
        T -- Invokes --> I
        I -- Queries state (read-only) --> T
        M -- Registers tools with --> H
    end
```
*   **Action Engine Components**:
    *   **Task Manager**: Central component managing the lifecycle of asynchronous tasks, orchestrating state changes, and interacting with other components.
    *   **SQLite State Persistence**: Provides durable storage for task state, using WAL mode for crash resilience.
*   **Thought Engine Components (V1 Focus)**:
    *   **Imperator**: The LLM reasoning core. It receives prompts from the Task Manager and queries state via a secure, read-only API provided by the Action Engine (REQ-FD-10).

#### **3.2. Data Flow (`fiedler_converse`)**

1.  MCP Server receives a `fiedler_converse` request.
2.  It immediately creates a new task in SQLite with `status: 'PENDING'` and a unique `task_id`.
3.  It responds instantly to the client with the `task_id` and `stream_topic` (`mad.stream.{task_id}`).
4.  The Task Manager picks up the task, updates its status to `RUNNING`, and invokes the Imperator.
5.  As the Imperator generates tokens, the Task Manager publishes each one to the `stream_topic` via the `joshua_conversation` client.
6.  Upon completion, the Task Manager updates the task in SQLite to `COMPLETED` (or `FAILED`) and publishes a final notification message to the original requester.

#### **3.3. State Machine (Task Lifecycle)**

This state machine ensures clear tracking and no silent failures (REQ-FD-06).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> PENDING: Create Task
    PENDING --> RUNNING: Task Manager starts execution
    RUNNING --> STREAMING: First token generated
    STREAMING --> RUNNING: Awaiting next token
    RUNNING --> COMPLETED: Execution successful
    STREAMING --> COMPLETED: Final token sent, success
    RUNNING --> FAILED: Error during execution
    STREAMING --> FAILED: Error during streaming
```

#### **3.4. API Specifications (MCP Tools)**

**1. `fiedler_converse` (REQ-FD-02)**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "fiedler_converse",
      "tool_input": {
        "prompt": "string",
        "requester_id": "string" // For final notification
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Immediate)**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "pending",
      "task_id": "uuid-string",
      "stream_topic": "mad.stream.uuid-string"
    }
    ```

**2. `fiedler_get_task_status`**
*   **Request Schema**:
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "fiedler_get_task_status",
      "tool_input": { "task_id": "uuid-string" }
    }
    ```
*   **Response Schema (Full State)**:
    ```json
    {
      "task_id": "uuid-string",
      "status": "PENDING | RUNNING | STREAMING | COMPLETED | FAILED",
      "prompt": "Original user prompt...",
      "result_payload": "object | null",
      "error_details": {
        "message": "Error message",
        "stack_trace": "Full stack trace..."
      },
      "created_at": "iso-8601-timestamp",
      "updated_at": "iso-8601-timestamp"
    }
    ```

#### **3.5. Database Schema (`fiedler_state.db`)**

**Table: `tasks`** (WAL Mode Enabled per REQ-FD-04)

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `task_id` | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | Unique UUID for the task. |
| `status` | TEXT | NOT NULL | PENDING, RUNNING, STREAMING, COMPLETED, FAILED. |
| `requester_id`| TEXT | NOT NULL | ID of the entity that initiated the task. |
| `prompt` | TEXT | NOT NULL | The initial natural language prompt. |
| `result_payload`| TEXT | | JSON blob of the final result on success. |
| `error_details` | TEXT | | JSON blob with message/stack trace on failure (REQ-FD-06). |
| `created_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO 8601 timestamp of creation. |
| `updated_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO 8601 timestamp of last update. |

### **4. Rogers V1 Design (Intelligent Conversation Bus)**

Rogers V1 is a full MAD that manages, monitors, and reports on the health and activity of the entire conversation bus.

#### **4.1. Architecture**

Rogers uses the full MAD structure to provide intelligence *about* the bus itself.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Rogers V1
        subgraph Action Engine
            M[MCP Server]
            CM[Connection Manager]
            MM[Metrics Collector]
            S[SQLite State Persistence <br/> (WAL Mode)]
            J[joshua_conversation Client]
            H[SSH Command Host]
        end

        subgraph Thought Engine
            I[Imperator (LLM)]
        end

        M -- Forwards conversational tasks --> I
        I -- Queries bus state (read-only) --> S
        J -- Bus Listener (`mad.#`) --> CM & MM
        CM -- Updates connection state --> S
        MM -- Updates metrics state --> S
        M -- Registers tools with --> H
    end
```

*   **Action Engine Components**:
    *   **Connection Manager (REQ-RG-14)**: Listens for system messages (e.g., heartbeats, connects) to maintain a live registry of participating MADs.
    *   **Metrics Collector (REQ-RG-15)**: Passively subscribes to all messages (`mad.#`) to gather statistics on traffic volume and topics.
*   **Thought Engine Components**:
    *   **Imperator (REQ-RG-02)**: Provides a natural language interface to query the state collected by the Action Engine (e.g., "Which MADs are most active?").

#### **4.2. Data Flows**

*   **Passive Collection**: Rogers' `joshua_conversation` client is always subscribed to `mad.#`. The Connection Manager and Metrics Collector handlers receive copies of all bus traffic and update their respective tables in SQLite.
*   **`rogers_converse`**: The flow is identical to Fiedler's, but the Imperator's read-only queries access Rogers' state tables (`connections`, `hourly_metrics`) to answer questions about the bus.

#### **4.3. API Specifications (MCP Tools)**

*   **`rogers_converse`**: Identical schema and behavior to `fiedler_converse` (REQ-RG-03).
*   **`rogers_get_task_status`**: Identical schema and behavior to `fiedler_get_task_status` (REQ-RG-05).
*   **`rogers_get_connections` (REQ-RG-11)**: A direct tool returning a list of connected MADs from the `connections` table.
*   **`rogers_get_stats` (REQ-RG-11)**: A direct tool returning aggregated metrics from the `hourly_metrics` table.

#### **4.4. Database Schema (`rogers_state.db`)**

**1. Table: `tasks`**
*   Identical structure to Fiedler's `tasks` table, used for Rogers' own conversational tasks.

**2. Table: `connections` (REQ-RG-14)**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `mad_id` | TEXT | PRIMARY KEY | The unique name of the connected MAD. |
| `status` | TEXT | NOT NULL | CONNECTED, HEALTHY, STALE, DISCONNECTED. |
| `connected_at` | TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO 8601 timestamp of first appearance. |
| `last_heartbeat`| TEXT | NOT NULL | ISO 8601 timestamp of last known activity. |

**3. Table: `hourly_metrics` (REQ-RG-15)**

| Column | Type | Constraints | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `hour_timestamp`| TEXT | | ISO 8601 timestamp for the hour bucket. |
| `sender_id` | TEXT | | The MAD sending the messages. |
| `topic_pattern` | TEXT | | Aggregated topic (e.g., 'mad.direct', 'mad.topic'). |
| `message_count` | INTEGER | NOT NULL | Count of messages for this aggregation bucket. |
| **PRIMARY KEY** | (`hour_timestamp`, `sender_id`, `topic_pattern`) |

---

### **5. Integration Patterns**

#### **5.1. Standard Message Envelope**

All messages published on the Rogers Bus MUST adhere to this standard JSON envelope (REQ-JC-05), ensuring consistent metadata for routing, tracing, and metrics.

```json
{
  "message_id": "uuid",         // Unique ID for this message
  "conversation_id": "uuid",    // ID for a multi-message exchange
  "correlation_id": "uuid",     // ID for tracing a single request across all systems
  "timestamp": "iso-8601",      // Message creation time
  "sender_id": "string",        // e.g., "fiedler"
  "recipient_id": "string|null",// For direct messages
  "channel": "string",          // The Redis channel it was published on
  "payload": {}                 // The actual message content
}
```

#### **5.2. Redis Pub/Sub Channels**

*   `mad.direct.{recipient_id}`: For messages directed to a single MAD.
*   `mad.topic.{topic_name}`: For broadcast messages related to a specific subject (e.g., `mad.topic.system_events`).
*   `mad.stream.{task_id}`: For streaming token responses from Fiedler or Rogers.
*   `mad.system.heartbeat`: Channel for MADs to publish periodic health checks.
*   `mad.#`: Wildcard pattern used exclusively by Rogers for metrics and connection tracking.

### **6. Deployment Architecture**

#### **6.1. File Structure (Monorepo)**

A monorepo will be used to manage all libraries, MADs, and configurations.

```

#### **6.2. Docker Compose & Networking**

A `docker-compose.yml` file will define the four services: `redis`, `grace`, `fiedler`, and `rogers`.
*   **Network**: All services will be placed on a single, isolated Docker bridge network (`mad-net`). No ports will be exposed to the host, except for the MCP servers if required for external access (via a gateway).
*   **Redis**: The Redis service will require a password, provided via the `.env` file (REQ-JC-09).
*   **SSH**: Each MAD's SSH server will be configured to listen only on the internal Docker network interface (REQ-JS-05). The `authorized_keys` file will be mounted as a read-only volume (REQ-JS-06).
*   **Volumes**: Named volumes will be used to persist the SQLite databases (`fiedler-data`, `rogers-data`) across container restarts.

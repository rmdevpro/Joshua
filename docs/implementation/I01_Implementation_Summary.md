## Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the ICCM (Intelligent Context and Conversation Management) system implementation plan. The implementation translates the theoretical framework from the 17 academic papers (v3) into a concrete, buildable system that can produce empirical results for publication.

**Primary Goal:** Build a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating that Context Engineering Transformers (CETs) can extract software requirements that enable LLMs to reconstruct functionally equivalent applications.

**Timeline:** 28 weeks (7 months)
**Team:** 5 people
**Budget:** $7,840 (one-time hardware, already spent) + ~$50/month (electricity)

---

## What We're Building

### Core System: CET-D for Requirements Engineering

A specialized transformer (1-7B parameters) that learns to:
1. Extract requirements from existing applications
2. Optimize context for downstream LLMs
3. Enable accurate reconstruction of original functionality

### Key Innovation: Reconstruction Testing

```
Application Source Code
         ↓
CET-D Extracts Requirements
         ↓
6 Local LLMs Generate Implementations
         ↓
Run Original Test Suite on All Implementations
         ↓
Success Metric: >75% Test Pass Rate
```

This provides an **objective, automated validation signal** for training the CET.

```

### Infrastructure Stack

**Foundation:**
- 4-6× P40 GPUs (96-144GB VRAM)
- 256GB RAM (critical for model caching)
- 4TB NVMe storage
- PostgreSQL 15+ with pgvector extension

**LLM Serving:**
- vLLM with tensor parallelism
- 3 hot models + RAM cache rotation (14× speedup)
- OpenAI-compatible API wrapper
- Load balancing across models

**Execution:**
- Docker Compose (not Kubernetes - right-sized for 5-person lab)
- Container pooling (10-20 warm containers)
- Resource isolation and network policies
- Test harness with parallel execution

**Storage:**
- Conversations: timestamped, embedded, semantically searchable
- Applications: source code, requirements, test suites
- Training signals: rewards, variance, test results
- Model checkpoints: versioned, backed up

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. All-Local LLM Orchestra (Not Paid APIs)
**Decision:** Use 6 local open-source models instead of GPT-4/Claude/Gemini APIs

**Benefits:**
- $0 monthly cost (vs $300-500 for APIs)
- Unlimited inference for training
- Full reproducibility (frozen weights)
- Better diversity (6 models vs 3 APIs)
- Privacy (no data to cloud)

**Trade-off:** Slightly lower individual model quality, but ensemble diversity compensates

### 2. Conversation Capture as First-Class Component
**Decision:** Wrap Claude Code to capture all conversations into PostgreSQL

**Benefits:**
- Real requirements engineering conversations as training data
- Foundation for future CET-P (personal context learning)
- Semantic search over historical discussions
- Learn from actual usage patterns

**Implementation:** MCP-based capture server → real-time DB writes with embeddings

### 3. Quality-Over-Quantity Dataset (50 apps, not 3,000+)
**Decision:** Focus on 50 high-quality, fully validated applications

**Benefits:**
- Enables 100% manual validation (gold standard)
- Rigorous statistical testing still valid
- Feasible for 5-person lab
- Addresses v2.1 reviewer concerns

**Trade-off:** Lower generalization initially, but can expand post-PoC

### 4. Docker Compose Over Kubernetes
**Decision:** Use Docker Compose for execution environment

**Benefits:**
- Matches scale (600-1,000 executions/day)
- Lower operational complexity
- Proven in 6-month operational test (Paper 09)
- Right-sized for research lab

**Trade-off:** Less scalable, but unnecessary complexity avoided

---

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics (Must Achieve)
- **Test Pass Rate:** >75% average on hold-out set
- **Statistical Significance:** CET-D beats RAG baseline by ≥15% (p<0.05)
- **Implementation Variance:** <20% across 6-model ensemble

### Secondary Metrics (Target)
- **Inference Speed:** <5s for requirements extraction
- **Context Compression:** >50% token reduction
- **Human Agreement:** >80% match with gold standard

### Infrastructure Metrics (Operational)
- **Uptime:** >99% for execution environment
- **Cost:** <$100/month (achieved via all-local models)
- **Throughput:** 600-1,000 test executions/day

---

## Risk Management

### High-Impact Risks
1. **Dataset Curation Bottleneck**
   - Mitigation: Start with 10 apps, automate environment setup, use synthetic data if needed

2. **Statistical Significance Not Achieved**
   - Mitigation: Iterate on Phase 3 training, expand dataset, try different architectures

3. **Generalization Beyond Software Domain**
   - Mitigation: Focus PoC on software, document limitations, propose future work

### Medium-Impact Risks
1. **VRAM Constraints for 6 Models**
   - Mitigation: Proven rotation strategy (Paper 08), RAM caching

2. **Conversation Capture Performance**
   - Mitigation: Async writes, batch embeddings, monitoring

3. **Catastrophic Forgetting in Phase 4**
   - Mitigation: Canary set monitoring, rollback capability

## Dependencies on Papers

This implementation directly validates claims from the v3 paper suite:

| Paper | What We're Proving | How |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| Paper 01, 02, 03 | CET concept is viable | Build and train CET-D |
| Paper 02 | Four-phase training works | Implement Phase 1-4 pipeline |
| Paper 04A, 06 | Reconstruction testing validates requirements | Achieve >75% test pass rate |
| Paper 05 | Requirements engineering is learnable | Beat RAG baseline statistically |
| Paper 08 | Infrastructure design is feasible | Build on $7,840 budget |
| Paper 09 | Docker Compose scales for research | 600-1,000 executions/day |
| Paper 10 | LLM orchestra provides diversity | Measure implementation variance |
| Paper 12 | PostgreSQL+pgvector handles workload | Store/retrieve conversations |

**Critical:** This implementation generates the **empirical results** that are currently missing from the papers. All four AI reviewers (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4.1, GPT-5, Grok 4) emphasized this gap.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan translates 17 academic papers into a concrete, buildable system. The focus is ruthlessly practical:

- **All-local infrastructure** - no dependency on paid APIs
- **Quality-over-quantity dataset** - rigorous validation on 50 apps
- **Objective metrics** - reconstruction testing provides clear success criteria
- **Phased approach** - prove each component before building the next
- **Empirical results** - what the papers are missing

**The goal is not just to build a system, but to generate the empirical evidence that makes the papers publishable.**

All four AI reviewers converged on the same recommendation: Build the PoC. This implementation plan is how we do it.

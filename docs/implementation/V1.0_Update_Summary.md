**Version:** v0.0 → v1.0
**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Added step-by-step MCP server setup instructions (5 steps)
- ✅ Added concrete Claude Code integration via `mcp_servers.json`
- ✅ Added performance impact measurement methodology
- ✅ Added latency monitoring code snippet
- **Rationale:** Make critical data collection component implementable

### I11: Production Pipeline
**Version:** v0.0 → v1.0
**Key Changes:**

- ✅ Added update frequency and batch size justification table
- ✅ Added explicit rollback mechanism with code
- ✅ Added A/B testing framework implementation
- ✅ Detailed online learning algorithm (weekly retraining, 1e-6 LR)
- **Rationale:** Clarify continuous learning feasibility

### I14: Model Architecture (NEW)
**Version:** v1.0 (newly created)
**Content:**
- ✅ Complete transformer architecture specs (1B, 3B, 5B variants)
- ✅ Training hyperparameters for Phase 1-4
- ✅ Memory and compute requirements per model size
- ✅ Progressive sizing strategy (1B → 3B → 5B)
- ✅ Baseline architecture selection (CodeT5)
- ✅ Hardware requirements and validation metrics
- **Rationale:** Address missing model architecture details from Opus review

### I00: Master Document
**Version:** v1.1 → v1.2
**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Added I14 to document structure
- ✅ Updated all document statuses to v1.0
- ✅ Added v1.2 changelog

### I01: Implementation Summary
**Version:** v1.0 → v1.1
**Key Changes:**
- ✅ Added I14 reference to system overview
- ✅ Updated document version references

### I03, I06-I10, I12-I13: Version Bumps
**Version:** v0.0 → v1.0
**Changes:**
- Status updated to v1.0 in I00 tracking
- Minor consistency improvements
- No major content changes (already solid per Opus review)

## Opus Review Feedback Addressed

### ⚠️ What Needed Improvement (ALL FIXED)

| Issue | Document | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Model architecture details missing | **NEW I14** | ✅ Created |
| Embedding model inconsistency | **I02** | ✅ Fixed |
| Conversation capture underspecified | **I05** | ✅ Enhanced |
| Dataset curation process vague | **I04** | ✅ Detailed |
| Phase 4 continuous learning vague | **I11** | ✅ Specified |

### ❌ What Was Missing (PARTIALLY ADDRESSED)

| Issue | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Failure recovery strategy | ⏳ Deferred to v1.1 | Add to I08, I09 |
| Inter-model communication | ⏳ Deferred to v1.1 | Add to I03 |
| Resource contention management | ⏳ Deferred to v1.1 | Add to I03 |
| Security considerations | ⏳ Deferred to v1.1 | Add to I02 |
| Scalability path | ⏳ Deferred to v1.1 | Add to I04 |

**Decision:** Focus v1.0 on top 5 critical issues. Address remaining 5 in v1.1 after next review round.

## Version Control Process

### Protocol Applied

1. ✅ **Archive Before Modify:** All v0.0 docs archived
2. ✅ **Changelog in Each Doc:** Added changelog section to modified docs
3. ✅ **Semantic Versioning:** Following papers pattern (v0.0 → v1.0 → v2.0 → v3.0)
4. ✅ **Master Document Tracking:** I00 updated with all version changes

### Next Steps for V1.1

**Review Process (mirroring papers):**
1. Send v1.0 docs to AI reviewers:
   - Gemini 2.5 Pro
   - GPT-5
   - Grok 4
2. Synthesize feedback
3. Archive v1.0 docs
4. Create v1.1 with reviewer feedback
5. Repeat for v2.0, v3.0

**Target:** Reach v3.0 to match paper versions (3 review rounds)

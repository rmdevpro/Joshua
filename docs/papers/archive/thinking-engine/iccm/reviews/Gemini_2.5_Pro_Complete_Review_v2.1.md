Based on the 17 provided source documents, here is a detailed analytical review of the proposed Intelligent Context and Conversation Management (ICCM) system.

***

### **1. Executive Summary**

The 17 papers collectively describe the Intelligent Context and Conversation Management (ICCM) system, a novel architecture designed to treat context engineering as a learnable, specialized capability for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance. The core of the system is the Context Engineering Transformer (CET), a smaller, specialized transformer model (1-7B parameters) that acts as a sophisticated pre-processor. Unlike traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that passively retrieve information, CETs actively filter, structure, and optimize context before it is passed to a general-purpose LLM. The architecture proposes three specialized variants: CET-P for privacy-preserving personal context on edge devices, CET-T for team-level collaboration, and CET-D for professional domain expertise, with the latter being the primary focus for the proof-of-concept (Paper 01, Paper 03).

The system's key collective innovation is a four-phase progressive training methodology designed to teach these CETs their specialized function. This methodology mirrors human skill acquisition: Phase 1 involves RAG-grounded subject matter acquisition; Phase 2 teaches context transformation skills; Phase 3, the most critical phase, involves interactive learning where the CET's effectiveness is measured by the quality of outputs from a diverse "LLM Orchestra" (Paper 10); and Phase 4 enables continuous self-improvement in production. A significant and recent innovation, detailed across several revised papers (Paper 02, 04A, 05, 06), is a pivot from general code generation to a "requirements-first" approach. In this paradigm, the CET-D learns to perform requirements engineering by extracting specifications from existing applications. The ultimate validation is "reconstruction testing": the success of an LLM team in rebuilding a functionally equivalent application from the extracted requirements, as measured by the original application's test suite, serves as an objective, scalable training signal. This shifts the validation from subjective code quality to a concrete, measurable outcome, forming the central thesis of the proposed implementation.

### **2. System Coherence Analysis**

The 17 papers present a remarkably coherent and logically structured vision for a unified system, though its internal consistency is a product of recent, deliberate evolution. The Master Document (Paper 00) serves as a crucial guide, documenting a significant strategic pivot that realigns the entire research program.

**Coherence and Logical Flow:**
The paper sequence flows logically from high-level theory to specific implementation details. It begins with the core theoretical framework in the Primary Paper (Paper 01), which introduces the four-phase training and the CET architecture. This is followed by deep dives into the training methodology (Paper 02) and architectural specialization (Paper 03). The subsequent papers (04A through 12) systematically detail the components required to realize this vision: the validation framework (04A, 06), the production learning pipeline (04B), the CET-D implementation itself (05), the ambitious self-bootstrapping capabilities (07A, 07B), and the underlying infrastructure for hardware (08), execution (09), model orchestration (10), testing (11), and data storage (12). The suite concludes with future-work papers (13, 14) that logically extend the core concepts. This structure allows a reader to progressively zoom in from the abstract concept to the concrete implementation details of each subsystem.

**Contradictions and Inconsistencies:**
The most significant potential for contradiction arises from the major pivot from a focus on direct code generation to a more sophisticated requirements-first approach. The changelogs in Paper 02, 04A, 04B, 05, and 06 explicitly state this restructuring. For example, Paper 02's changelog notes a shift where "Phase 3 validation from code execution to reconstruction testing" is the new focus. This change is consistently reflected across the core implementation papers. Paper 04A, formerly about code error analysis, is now entirely focused on "Requirements Validation Through Reconstruction Testing," and Paper 05, the CET-D implementation, has been refocused on requirements engineering.

However, this pivot creates a subtle tension with the Primary Paper (Paper 01), which still frames the proof-of-concept in terms of direct software development metrics like "generating compilable code context" and "bug fixing." While not a direct contradiction—as requirements engineering ultimately serves these goals—the emphasis is different. The Primary Paper (Paper 01) presents the *what* and *why* at a high level, while the sub-papers (02, 04A, 05, 06) present a more refined and methodologically robust *how*. The system's coherence relies on understanding that the requirements-first approach is the *mechanism* chosen to achieve the software development goals outlined in the primary paper.

Another area of evolution, rather than contradiction, is the "reality check" documented in Paper 00 regarding the execution infrastructure. The initial enterprise-grade Kubernetes design (archived v1 of Paper 09) was recognized as "overkill" and replaced with a pragmatic Docker Compose solution detailed in the final version of Paper 09. This self-correction strengthens the project's coherence by aligning the infrastructure's complexity with the stated context of a small research lab, a point reinforced by the pragmatic hardware choices in Paper 08. The recombination of the split architecture and security papers (08A and 08B) into a single, unified Paper 09 further enhances logical flow, as both told the "same story for the same context" (Paper 00).

### **3. Requirements-First Approach Evaluation**

The strategic shift from direct code generation to a requirements-first paradigm, validated by reconstruction testing, is arguably the most sophisticated and technically sound aspect of the entire ICCM proposal. It addresses a fundamental weakness in evaluating generative AI for software engineering: the subjectivity of "good code."

**Technical Soundness:**
The approach is technically sound because it establishes an objective, measurable, and scalable success metric. The methodology, as described in Paper F03 and implemented in the validation frameworks (Paper 04A, Paper 06), is: `Real Application -> CET-D Extracts Requirements -> LLM Orchestra Regenerates Application -> Original Test Suite Validates Regeneration`. Success is quantified by the test pass rate of the regenerated application. A target of >75% pass rate (Paper 02) provides a clear, unambiguous signal for reinforcement learning in Phase 3. This transforms the abstract goal of "understanding requirements" into a concrete, optimizable target.

This method cleverly uses the existing test suite of a real-world application as ground-truth validation. It sidesteps the need to manually create validation datasets for requirements, which would be a monumental and subjective task. Instead, it leverages the collective effort already invested in the application's own quality assurance. The use of a multi-LLM orchestra (Paper 10) for the reconstruction step is also critical; if multiple, diverse models can successfully implement the requirements, it strongly implies the requirements are not just complete but also unambiguous (Paper 04A).

**Adequacy of Reconstruction Testing:**
Reconstruction testing provides remarkably adequate validation, far exceeding simple code-level metrics. It validates multiple facets of requirements quality simultaneously:
*   **Completeness:** If requirements are missing, the regenerated application will fail functional tests.
*   **Clarity/Ambiguity:** If requirements are ambiguous, different LLMs will produce divergent implementations, leading to inconsistent test results and high "implementation variance" (Paper 04A, Paper 06).
*   **Correctness:** The test suite directly verifies if the extracted requirements accurately reflect the original application's behavior.
*   **Interface Preservation:** API compatibility checks ensure that the system's contracts are correctly specified (Paper 04A).

While it doesn't directly measure the quality of the requirements *document* (e.g., readability for a human), it provides a robust proxy for the quality that matters most: whether the requirements are sufficient for a competent developer (or an LLM) to build the correct system.

**Comparison to Traditional Requirements Engineering:**
This approach is a significant departure from traditional requirements engineering (RE) methodologies like those described in IEEE 29148 or SWEBOK (referenced in Paper 02).
*   **Traditional RE:** Relies heavily on manual elicitation (interviews, workshops), analysis, and validation through human review, walkthroughs, and prototyping. Validation is often qualitative and consensus-based. Traceability is a manual, tool-assisted process.
*   **ICCM Approach:** Is a form of automated requirements *extraction* or *reverse engineering* from an existing system. The validation is automated, quantitative, and continuous. It doesn't replace upfront RE for new systems but offers a powerful solution for legacy modernization, documentation of existing systems, and creating a baseline for further development.

The ICCM method essentially creates a feedback loop that was previously missing in automated requirements extraction. Traditional tools might parse code to generate documentation, but they have no way of knowing if that documentation is *sufficient* for rebuilding the system. By closing the loop with reconstruction and testing, the ICCM system can *learn* what constitutes a complete and unambiguous requirements specification.

### **4. Comparison to Academic Research**

The ICCM system synthesizes and extends concepts from multiple research fields, with its primary novelty lying in their integration into a cohesive, learning-based architecture.

**Requirements Engineering (RE):**
The proposed requirements-first approach is a novel contribution to automated RE. While academic research has explored requirements extraction from various artifacts (code, documentation, user feedback), it has struggled with validation. The ICCM's "reconstruction testing" (Paper 04A, 06) provides a powerful, objective validation mechanism that is largely absent in the literature. It operationalizes the validation and verification (V&V) processes described in standards like **IEEE 29148** in a fully automated loop. Unlike traditional RE, which focuses on eliciting requirements from stakeholders, this work focuses on extracting them from an existing implementation, making it highly relevant to research in software maintenance, reverse engineering, and legacy system modernization.

**Context Learning Approaches:**
The CET architecture represents a conceptual advance over standard context learning methods.
*   **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** RAG is a reactive, single-step process: retrieve and append. CETs, in contrast, are proactive *engineers* of context. They perform multi-step transformations, filtering, structuring, and prioritizing information based on a learned understanding of what produces effective downstream results (Paper 01, 03). Phase 1 explicitly uses RAG for initial knowledge grounding, but the subsequent phases learn a far more sophisticated policy.
*   **Long-Context Models:** While models like Gemini 2.5 Pro with 1M+ token contexts can ingest large amounts of raw information, they still face the "lost in the middle" problem where performance degrades as context length increases. CETs address this by intelligently compressing and structuring the context, ensuring the most relevant information is salient, effectively performing "attention" before the model's own attention mechanism.
*   **Memory-Augmented Networks:** Systems like Memory Networks or Transformer-XL aim to extend the effective context window. CETs are philosophically different; they are not just about *extending* memory but about *curating* it. The specialized P/T/D architecture (Paper 03) is a form of structured, hierarchical memory that standard memory-augmented networks lack.

**LLM Specialization and Domain Adaptation:**
The CET architecture is a novel form of domain adaptation. Instead of fine-tuning a massive LLM on domain-specific data, the ICCM approach trains a much smaller, specialized pre-processor. This is architecturally distinct from methods like fine-tuning, LoRA, or prompt tuning. It is a form of **modular specialization**, where the general reasoning capabilities of the large LLM are preserved, while the domain-specific context handling is offloaded to an efficient, expert module. This modularity is a key advantage, allowing for the composition of different CETs (e.g., `User -> CET-P -> CET-T -> CET-D -> LLM`) as described in Paper 03, a flexibility not easily achieved with monolithic fine-tuned models.

**Automated Software Engineering (ASE):**
The ICCM system, particularly with its self-bootstrapping capabilities (Papers 07A, 07B), aligns with the grand challenges of ASE.
*   **Automated Program Repair (APR):** Research in APR often involves generating patches and validating them against a failing test case. The bug detection and fixing loop in Paper 07B is a sophisticated form of APR that includes root cause analysis and learns from past fixes.
*   **Automated Test Generation:** The system uses existing tests for validation but also describes generating tests for uncovered paths (Paper 11) and for validating its own generated tools (Paper 07A), aligning with research in search-based and symbolic-execution-based test generation.
*   **Self-Improving Systems:** The concept of a system that improves its own code (Paper 07B) is a long-standing goal in ASE. The ICCM's approach is novel in its use of a learning-based transformer (CET-D) to guide these improvements, driven by concrete metrics from performance profiling and bug detection, creating a closed loop of meta-improvement.

### **5. Comparison to Industry Practice**

The ICCM system, if realized, would represent a significant leap beyond current industry standards in code generation, requirements management, and production LLM architecture.

**Code Generation Tools:**
*   **GitHub Copilot, Codeium, Cursor:** These tools are primarily auto-completers or in-IDE assistants. They are stateless, reactive, and operate on a local context window (open files). The ICCM system is a proactive, stateful, and continuously learning pipeline. The CET architecture provides a persistent, evolving model of the user, team, and domain context that is far more sophisticated than the simple retrieval used by tools like Cursor or the prompt-based context of Copilot.
*   **Windsurf (Google):** While details are sparse, Windsurf appears to be a more advanced system for large-scale code modifications. However, the ICCM's explicit focus on a learnable context engineering module and the transparent four-phase training methodology appears distinct. The self-bootstrapping aspect (Papers 07A, 07B), where the system generates its own tooling and optimizations, seems more ambitious than what is publicly described for most industry tools.

**Requirements Tools:**
*   **Jira, Azure DevOps, DOORS:** These are systems of record for managing and tracking human-created requirements. They are databases with workflow and collaboration features. The ICCM system is fundamentally different: it *generates* requirements from code. It could potentially feed its output into a tool like Jira, but its function is generative, not managerial. It aims to solve the problem of documenting legacy systems, a task for which tools like DOORS are notoriously cumbersome.

**AI Memory Systems:**
*   **ChatGPT Memory, Claude Projects, Custom Instructions:** These are rudimentary forms of context persistence. ChatGPT's memory is a simple mechanism for storing user-stated facts. Claude's projects allow for uploading documents for a session. Custom Instructions are static directives. The CET-P/T/D architecture (Paper 03) is a multi-layered, dynamic, and *learning* memory system. CET-P (Paper 14) running on the edge is architecturally far more advanced and privacy-preserving than any current commercial offering. It doesn't just store facts; it learns a user's style, preferences, and knowledge, and actively engineers context based on this learned model.

**Production LLM Systems:**
Most production LLM systems today rely on a combination of a base model, fine-tuning for specific tasks, and a RAG pipeline for grounding. The ICCM's proposed architecture is more complex and modular.
*   The use of a specialized, smaller pre-processing model (CET) is not a common pattern. Most systems put the complexity in the retrieval/RAG stage or in the fine-tuning process. The CET is a distinct architectural layer.
*   The LLM Orchestra (Paper 10) reflects a pragmatic approach seen in some advanced industry systems: a multi-tier system combining local open-source models for cost-efficiency, pay-per-token APIs for scalable access to frontier models, and premium APIs for validation. This hybrid strategy is realistic and cost-effective.
*   The containerized execution environment (Paper 09) is a well-reasoned, pragmatic solution for a research or small team setting. The explicit rejection of Kubernetes in favor of Docker Compose for this scale is a mature engineering decision that contrasts with the "Kubernetes-by-default" mindset in many larger organizations.

### **6. Novelty Assessment**

The ICCM proposal contains a mix of genuinely novel concepts and incremental improvements on existing ideas. The primary innovation lies in the synthesis of these ideas into a single, cohesive learning system.

**Genuinely Novel Contributions:**
1.  **The Context Engineering Transformer (CET) as a distinct architectural component:** The idea of a smaller, specialized transformer whose sole purpose is to learn the task of context optimization is the most groundbreaking concept. It reframes context handling from a passive retrieval problem to an active, learned engineering discipline (Paper 01, 03).
2.  **Requirements Validation via Reconstruction Testing:** This is a truly innovative and powerful methodology. Using the round-trip process of `code -> requirements -> code` and validating with the original test suite provides an objective, scalable, and automated reward signal for a complex task (requirements engineering) that has historically been difficult to evaluate automatically (Paper 02, 04A, 06). This is the most significant methodological innovation in the suite.
3.  **The Complete Self-Bootstrapping Loop:** While self-improving systems are a long-standing research goal, the detailed, two-part proposal for building new capabilities (Paper 07A) and then continuously improving existing ones (Paper 07B) is a comprehensive and ambitious vision. The metrics provided (e.g., 40% velocity acceleration) suggest a concrete implementation plan, moving it beyond pure theory. Paper 07B, in particular, presents a novel framework for meta-improvement.

**Incremental Improvements:**
1.  **Four-Phase Progressive Training:** The idea of progressive or curriculum learning is not new. However, its specific application here—from subject expertise to context skills to interactive optimization—is a well-structured and logical framework tailored for the context engineering task (Paper 01, 02).
2.  **LLM Orchestra:** Multi-LLM ensembles and model routing are known techniques. The novelty in Paper 10 lies in its pragmatic three-tier architecture (local, pay-per-token, premium) and its detailed cost-benefit analysis, providing a realistic blueprint for research labs.
3.  **Edge CET-P with Federated Learning:** Deploying models on the edge and using federated learning for privacy are established research areas. The innovation in Paper 14 is the application of this paradigm to the specific task of personal context engineering, creating a system with architectural privacy guarantees that far exceed current industry offerings.

**What Already Exists:**
*   Using RAG for grounding LLMs (used in Phase 1).
*   Containerizing code execution for safety (Paper 09 builds on standard Docker practices).
*   Using CI/CD pipelines for automated testing (Paper 11 applies standard DevOps principles).
*   Using PostgreSQL with `pgvector` for hybrid storage (Paper 12 is a practical application of existing technology).

In summary, the groundbreaking ideas are concentrated in **Paper 01/03 (CET concept)**, **Paper 02/04A/06 (Reconstruction Testing)**, and **Papers 07A/07B (Self-Bootstrapping)**. The other papers provide strong, pragmatic, and well-researched support for implementing these core innovations.

### **7. Technical Feasibility**

The proposed system, while ambitious, appears technically feasible given the specified resources and phased approach. The authors have demonstrated a strong grasp of practical constraints through several "reality checks."

**Hardware and Budget:**
The detailed hardware breakdown in Paper 08 is highly credible. The total cost of **$7,840** for a heterogeneous cluster with 156GB of total VRAM is realistic for a well-funded academic lab or a small startup. The bottleneck analysis is particularly compelling: the authors correctly identified model loading as the key bottleneck and solved it with a cost-effective **$200 RAM upgrade** for caching, achieving a 14x speedup. This demonstrates a mature, measurement-driven approach to infrastructure optimization, lending significant credibility to their feasibility claims. The monthly operational cost estimate of **$300-500/month** (Paper 10), achieved through the three-tier LLM Orchestra, is also realistic and makes the project sustainable.

**Training Phases:**
The four training phases described in Paper 02 are logically sound and appear realistic to implement.
*   **Phase 1 (RAG):** This is a standard, well-understood technique. Feasible.
*   **Phase 2 (Degradation/Reconstruction):** Generating training pairs from Phase 1 data is a straightforward data augmentation strategy. Feasible.
*   **Phase 3 (Interactive Feedback):** This is the most complex phase. However, the infrastructure to support it is well-defined: the LLM Orchestra (Paper 10) for generating diverse responses and the containerized execution environment (Paper 09) for running reconstruction tests. The operational results from Paper 09 (135,000 executions over 6 months with 99.8% uptime) prove that the execution backend is robust and ready. This phase is challenging but feasible.
*   **Phase 4 (Continuous Improvement):** This involves deploying the model and learning from production feedback, a common practice in MLOps. The pipeline described in Paper 04B is complex but builds on standard monitoring and feedback loop principles. Feasible.

**Infrastructure:**
The infrastructure choices are pragmatic and appropriate for the stated scale.
*   **Docker Compose over Kubernetes (Paper 09):** The decision to use Docker Compose for a 5-person lab with 600-1,000 executions/day is an excellent engineering choice. It avoids massive operational overhead while providing all necessary functionality (isolation, orchestration). The reported 3 hours of maintenance over 6 months is a testament to this simplicity.
*   **LLM Orchestra (Paper 10):** The hybrid local/cloud model is a cost-effective and resilient strategy. The detailed cost-benefit analysis, including the ROI calculation for adding more local GPUs, is thorough and convincing.
*   **PostgreSQL + pgvector (Paper 12):** The choice of a proven relational database with a vector extension over a dedicated vector DB is well-justified for the project's query patterns, which mix relational filtering with semantic search. This simplifies the tech stack and reduces operational burden.

Overall, the technical plan is not just a theoretical proposal; it is grounded in a detailed, costed, and performance-analyzed infrastructure plan that has, in part (the execution environment), already been built and stress-tested. The most ambitious parts, like the full self-bootstrapping cycle, remain to be proven but the foundational components are sound.

### **8. Critical Gaps and Weaknesses**

Despite the comprehensive nature of the proposal, several critical gaps and potential failure points need to be addressed.

**Methodological Gaps:**
1.  **Scale of Reconstruction Testing Data:** The success of the requirements-first approach hinges on a large and diverse dataset of real-world applications. Paper F03 mentions a target of "3,000+ real-world applications." Acquiring, cleaning, and setting up the build/test environments for such a diverse set of applications is a monumental engineering challenge in itself, far exceeding the complexity of the rest of the system. Failure to build this dataset would cripple the entire training methodology.
2.  **Non-Software Domains:** The entire validation paradigm of "reconstruction testing" is brilliantly tailored to the software domain, where objective metrics (compilation, test pass rates) exist. The papers are largely silent on how this methodology would translate to other professional domains (e.g., legal, medical, finance) where CET-D is envisioned to operate. How do you "reconstruct and test" a legal brief or a medical diagnosis? This is a major gap in the generalizability of the core thesis.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop for Requirements:** The system is presented as highly autonomous. However, requirements engineering is often a deeply collaborative process involving negotiation and clarification with stakeholders. The current model extracts requirements from code, but it lacks a clear mechanism for incorporating human feedback to refine or correct high-level requirements that may be ambiguous or underspecified even in the original code.

**Potential Failure Points:**
1.  **Brittle Self-Improvement:** The self-bootstrapping and continuous improvement cycles (Papers 07A, 07B) are the most ambitious and riskiest parts of the project. A bug in the meta-improvement logic could lead to catastrophic degradation, where the system "improves" itself into a non-functional state. The safety mechanisms described are good, but complex, emergent failure modes are a significant risk.
2.  **Quality of the LLM Orchestra:** The training of CETs depends on the quality and diversity of the feedback from the LLM Orchestra. If the underlying LLMs are all flawed in similar ways (e.g., common security vulnerabilities, logical reasoning gaps), the CET may learn to optimize for these flawed patterns, effectively encoding bad practices. The system's quality is capped by the quality of its "LLM teachers."
3.  **Semantic Drift in Bidirectional Processing:** The future-work proposal for bidirectional processing (Paper 13) faces the risk of semantic drift. Each transformation step in the reverse pass (`LLM -> CET-D -> CET-T -> CET-P -> User`) could introduce subtle changes in meaning, potentially resulting in a final response that is personalized but factually incorrect or semantically divergent from the LLM's original intent.

**Areas Needing More Validation:**
*   **CET-P on the Edge (Paper 14):** While the architectural plan is sound, the performance targets (<50ms inference, <5% battery impact) on highly constrained hardware are aggressive. Real-world validation is needed to prove that the compressed 1-3B parameter models retain enough capability to be useful.
*   **CET-T for Team Coordination:** This is the least-developed concept of the three CET variants. The dynamics of multi-agent (human and AI) collaboration are extremely complex. More research is needed to define what "optimizing team context" means in practice and how to measure its success.

### **9. Implementation Recommendations**

To de-risk this ambitious project and validate its core thesis efficiently, implementation should be prioritized in a phased manner, focusing on the most novel and critical components first.

**Priority 1: Validate the Core Thesis (Reconstruction Testing)**
The most crucial step is to build a proof-of-concept (PoC) that validates the requirements-first approach.
*   **Action:** Implement the core loop: CET-D extracts requirements, the LLM Orchestra attempts reconstruction, and the validation framework (Paper 06) measures the test pass rate.
*   **Scope:** Start with a small, curated set of 10-20 well-tested, medium-complexity Python applications (as suggested in Paper 02). This avoids the massive data engineering challenge of the full 3,000+ app dataset while still being sufficient to prove the principle.
*   **Success Metric:** Achieve the target of >75% average test pass rate on regenerated applications across the PoC dataset. This single result would provide strong evidence for the entire ICCM concept.

**Priority 2: De-risk Key Infrastructure**
While building the PoC, focus on the most critical and novel infrastructure components.
*   **Action:** Fully implement and stress-test the Phase 3 training loop. This involves integrating the LLM Orchestra (Paper 10), the containerized execution environment (Paper 09), and the data storage backend (Paper 12).
*   **Rationale:** Phase 3 is the heart of the learning process. Ensuring this complex interaction of components is robust and performant is essential for the project's success. The existing work on Paper 09 provides a strong foundation.

**Priority 3: Systematically Expand and Refine**
Once the core thesis is validated on a small scale, systematically expand the system's capabilities.
*   **Expand the Dataset:** Gradually increase the number and diversity of applications used for reconstruction testing. This will improve the generalizability of the trained CET-D.
*   **Implement CET-P:** The personal, edge-deployed CET (Paper 14) is a high-impact, largely parallelizable workstream. Its focus on privacy is a major differentiator. A PoC could involve training a CET-P on a user's email archive to personalize responses.
*   **Begin Self-Bootstrapping (Cautiously):** Start with the simplest self-bootstrapping tasks from Paper 07A, such as generating utility functions or simple data processing tools. The full continuous improvement loop of Paper 07B should be deferred until the core system is highly mature and stable.

**What to Defer:**
*   **Full-Scale Self-Improvement (Paper 07B):** This is a high-risk, high-reward component. It should only be attempted after the base CET-D is proven to be highly reliable.
*   **Bidirectional Processing (Paper 13):** This is a significant architectural extension. The value of the unidirectional system should be proven first.
*   **CET-T (Team Context):** This is the most abstract and difficult-to-validate CET variant. It should be the last to be implemented, building on lessons learned from CET-D and CET-P.

By following this prioritized roadmap, the project can systematically de-risk its most ambitious claims and build a solid foundation of validated results before tackling the more speculative and complex future-work components. The initial PoC on reconstruction testing is the single most important next step.

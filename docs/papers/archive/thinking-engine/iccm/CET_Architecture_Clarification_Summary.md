# CET Architecture Clarification Summary

**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Purpose:** Document the correct understanding of CET architecture after detailed discussion

---

## Core Definition

**The CET is a context engineer.** It takes raw inputs and generates optimized context.

---

## The Pipeline Architecture

### Basic Flow:
```
User/System Prompt → CET → Context → LLM → Output → Validation → Learning → CET
```

### Multi-CET Composition:
```
Prompt → CET-P → Personal Context → CET-D → Domain Context → LLM → Output
```

Or with more layers:
```
Prompt → CET-P → CET-T → CET-D → LLM
         Personal  Team    Domain
```

## What CETs Do

### CET Inputs:
- User or system prompts
- Current context
- Chat history
- Subject matter expertise
- Previous CET's output (in multi-CET pipelines)

### CET Output:
- **Optimized context** (and nothing else)

### What CETs Generate:
- ✅ Context
- ✅ Engineered context
- ✅ Optimized context
- ✅ Transformed context

### What CETs Do NOT Generate:
- ❌ Requirements
- ❌ Code
- ❌ Documentation
- ❌ Specifications
- ❌ Any final outputs

## How the System Works

1. **Prompt enters system** (from user in production, from system in training)
2. **CET(s) generate context** by processing the prompt plus their specialized knowledge
3. **LLM processes context** and generates actual outputs (code, requirements, etc.)
4. **Outputs are validated** through testing or evaluation
5. **Learning signal returns to CET** about whether its context led to success
6. **Cycle repeats**, with CET improving its context generation

---

## Training vs Production

The pipeline is **identical** in training and production. The only difference:

- **Training**: System generates prompts automatically
- **Production**: Users provide prompts

Everything else works exactly the same way. This is why training is effective - the CET learns to do exactly what it will do in production.

---

## Multi-CET Composition

CETs can be chained, with each generating specialized context that builds on the previous:

- **CET-P (Personal)**: Generates context about user preferences, style, history
- **CET-T (Team)**: Adds team conventions, standards, patterns
- **CET-D (Domain)**: Adds domain expertise, technical knowledge

Each CET:
1. Takes what it receives (prompt or previous context)
2. Generates its specialized context additions
3. Passes enhanced context forward

The context becomes richer and more optimized at each step.

## Key Insights

1. **CETs are context engineers, not content generators**
   - They generate context
   - LLMs generate everything else

2. **The feedback loop teaches context quality**
   - CET learns which context patterns lead to successful LLM outputs
   - Learning signal comes from validating the LLM's output, not the CET's context directly

3. **Composition enables specialization**
   - Each CET can focus on one type of context
   - Multiple CETs build rich, multi-layered context

4. **Training mirrors production**
   - Same pipeline, just different prompt source
   - Ensures learned behaviors transfer directly

5. **Context is the only CET output**
   - This is what makes CETs feasible at 3-7B parameters
   - They don't need to know how to generate code/requirements
   - They only need to know what context helps LLMs succeed

---

## Why This Architecture Works

- **Separation of concerns**: Context engineering vs content generation
- **Smaller models**: CETs can be 3-7B params instead of 70B+
- **Composability**: Stack CETs for different specializations
- **Clear learning signal**: Test results show if context was helpful
- **Direct training**: Training matches production exactly

---

## Implications for Papers

Most papers are correct when they say "CET generates context." Problems only occur when papers claim CETs generate:
- Requirements (Papers 02, 05)
- Code (Paper 07A)
- Other non-context outputs

These need correction to maintain architectural consistency.

*This clarification resolves the confusion about what CETs generate and confirms they are context engineers, not content generators.*

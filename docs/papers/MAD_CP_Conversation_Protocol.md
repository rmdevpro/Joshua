# MAD CP - MAD Conversation Protocol

## Status: Raw Conversation - To be formalized later

**User:** ok, now pick one out of the extensive list of possibilities that would be useful for two pieces of software talking to each other

**Google AI:** A suitable abbreviation for two pieces of software to communicate would be API...

**User:** i didnt ask for an API, I asked for the list from the common human usage. I want this to be readable by both humans and machines

**Google AI:** To provide an abbreviation that is understandable by both humans and machines... FYI...

**User:** consider the software addressing each other as people would, for for example. RU experiencing errors

**Google AI:** An effective conversational abbreviation for software that can be read by both humans and machines, similar to "RU," would be "HRU?" (How are you?).

**User:** yes now you have the idea. I want to develop a free form conversation language that is abriveated for efficiency but readable by LLMs talking to each other and humans who dont have deep technical expertise. The humans understand the technology at a high level, but could not read code for example

**Google AI:** [Provided extensive list of abbreviations and examples of human-like software communication]

**User:** I would not take some of the more format oriented parts as a part of the protocol. the send>recipeint part is captured in the metadate of the convesation to a large extene. However you probably use the @ sign to name someone. @Fiedler, r u ok?

**Assistant:** Perfect! The @ mention approach like social media, not formal SENDER > RECIPIENT.

**User:** Its largely a chat conversation like you would have in MS Teams, with the same kind of features

**Assistant:** Added clarification - think MS Teams, Slack, Discord.

**User:** @Dewey import //irina/temp/conversation.yml

**Assistant:** Perfect example of clean MAD CP - @ mention, deterministic command, file path.

**User:** fixed content would be largely linked.

**Assistant:** Clarified that fixed content (files, images, data) is linked via paths, not embedded.

**User:** and humans and systems alike may share the same namespace (although maybe it should be different). So would be @J. And you could write: @Fielder can u send @j the LLM costs for Jan

**Assistant:** Added that humans and MADs share same @ namespace, can address each other naturally.

**User:** if the format is standard enough (which would happen machine to machine) the router will pick it up and route it. If its more prose like but still deterministic CNN based system would pick it up, and if neither could handle it it would pass through the CET to the Imperator

**Assistant:** Explained how MAD CP integrates with three-tier cognitive architecture:
- DTR picks up standard format
- LPPM picks up prose-like deterministic patterns
- CET + Imperator handles what neither can

**User:** This why its important for the router to be a decision tree as opposed to a runes engine because as commands become more deterministic as the machines will naturally do to be efficient, each part of the three tier architecture leans the patterns instead of having to publish a formal protocol. In fact you could have a review process of some sort where common patters would become identified and a system wide Thought Engine message could be sent to assist with learning.

**Assistant:** Explained why ML-based routing (not rules engine) enables organic protocol evolution without formal specs.

**User:** a set of constitutional rules will apply likley but mostly that would be to prevent the machines from using efficient messaging at a level that the humans cannot understand it anymore

**Assistant:** Added constitutional rules to preserve human readability - prevent evolution to incomprehensible formats.

**User:** otherwise the conversation will be HEX!

**Assistant:** Added example showing without rules conversation would compress to 0x47445f44...

**User:** its probaly the job of an LLM to patrol this because they understand human readability

**Assistant:** Added that LLM-based monitor validates readability inherently.

**User:** @dewey speak English pls

**Assistant:** Added that humans can directly tell MADs when they've gotten too compressed.

**User:** in order to manage machine traffic however, there probably has to be some kind of acknoweldge of reciept that does not appear to the human participants generally, but I think is probably part of the conversation. The chatters could probaly choose to see the kind of messages they want to see. But even that could be tag like instead of protocol based.

**Assistant:** Explained tag-based filtering (#ack, #status, #error, #human) - all one conversation, just filtered views.

**User:** right you could see an engineer trying to debug a weird conversation removing his ACK filter to see if one machine is acknowlegin the other

**Assistant:** Added debugging scenario showing value of removing filters to see machine traffic.

**User:** I imagine logging uses the same approach but may exist in other conversational streams

**Assistant:** Explained logging as separate conversation streams using same MAD CP approach.

**User:** although I suppose, if a human wnated to, he could join the logging conversation

**Assistant:** Emphasized logs ARE conversations - humans can join anytime, ask questions directly.

**User:** the log keeper MAD is just alwasy subscribed to all logging conversatiohns

**Assistant:** Clarified Godot is just always subscribed to logging conversations (like stenographer).

**User:** which then means that logs and conversations are not separate things. So perhaps there is nothing that captures logs. Its just part of what Rogers does

**Assistant:** Realized logs and conversations are the same thing - Rogers manages all conversations, no separate Godot needed.

**User:** I suppose for consistency of terminology, one would "Join" or "Leave" the conversation and not "Subscribe"

**Assistant:** Fixed terminology to join/leave (not subscribe/unsubscribe) - consistent with chat paradigm.

**User:** yes and so chat systems between people and machine traffic all share the same paradigm

**Key Insight:** **One paradigm for everything** - human chat, MAD coordination, machine traffic, logging, monitoring - all use same conversation model.

## Core Concepts Captured

### Three Content Types
1. **Deterministic**: Commands and code
2. **Fixed**: Data files, images - **linked via paths** not embedded
3. **Prose**: Natural language with abbreviations

### Addressing
- Use **@ mentions** like Teams/Slack
- Humans and MADs share namespace: `@J`, `@Fiedler`, `@Dewey`
- Example: `@Fiedler can u send @J the LLM costs for Jan`

### Integration with Three-Tier Architecture
- **DTR** (microseconds): Picks up standard format machine-to-machine
- **LPPM** (milliseconds): Picks up prose-like deterministic patterns
- **CET + Imperator** (seconds): Handles what neither can

### Why ML-Based Routing (Not Rules Engine)
- Machines naturally optimize toward efficiency
- Patterns learned organically, no formal protocol updates
- No versioning hell
- System-wide learning broadcasts possible

### Constitutional Rules
- Prevent compression to incomprehensible levels
- Without rules â†’ conversation evolves to HEX!
- LLM-based monitor validates readability
- Humans can say: `@Dewey speak English pls`

### Tag-Based Filtering
- `#ack` - Acknowledgments
- `#status` - Status updates
- `#error` - Errors
- `#human` - Human-relevant messages
- `#metric` - Metrics

All in one conversation, participants filter what they see.

### Logs ARE Conversations
- No separate logging system
- Logging is just conversations tagged with `#status`, `#error`, `#metric`
- **Rogers manages ALL conversations** (working, logging, everything)
- Humans can **join** logging conversations anytime
- Terminology: **join/leave** (not subscribe/unsubscribe)

### The Paradigm
**Everything is a conversation:**
- Human-to-human chat
- Human-to-MAD coordination
- MAD-to-MAD communication
- Machine ACKs and status
- Error logging
- Metrics and monitoring

One conversation model. One storage (Rogers). One interface.

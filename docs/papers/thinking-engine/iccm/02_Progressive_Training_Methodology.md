# Four-Phase Progressive Training for Context Engineering Transformers: Requirements Engineering Specialization

## Abstract

We present a detailed methodology for training Context Engineering Transformers (CETs) through four progressive phases that mirror human skill acquisition, specialized for requirements engineering. Each phase builds upon the previous, creating a comprehensive learning pathway from requirements expertise to production-ready context optimization. Using software requirements extraction and validation as our primary domain, we demonstrate how reconstruction testing provides objective training signals. Our approach transforms deployed applications into comprehensive requirements through systematic skill development, interactive feedback with LLM implementation teams, and continuous refinement through autonomous reconstruction validation.

**Key Innovation**: By focusing on requirements engineering rather than direct code generation, we achieve objective validation through reconstruction testing—if extracted requirements enable >75% test pass rate on regenerated applications, the CET has successfully learned requirements engineering.

## 1. Introduction

Context engineering for requirements extraction cannot be learned in a single training phase. Like human requirements engineers who first master specification standards before developing extraction skills, CETs require progressive training that builds capabilities incrementally.

**Requirements Engineering as Training Domain**: We choose requirements engineering over direct code generation for three critical reasons:

1. **Objective Validation**: Reconstruction testing provides clear success metrics (test pass rates, API compatibility)
2. **Focused Subject Area**: Requirements engineering standards vs. all of programming
3. **Practical Utility**: Requirements extraction enables legacy modernization, documentation, and autonomous reconstruction

This paper details how the four-phase progressive training methodology (Paper 01) applies specifically to requirements engineering specialization.

## 2. Phase 1: Requirements Engineering Expertise Acquisition

### 2.1 Objective

Establish foundational knowledge in requirements engineering through exposure to standards, methodologies, specifications, and validated examples from real-world applications.

**Training Goal**: CET learns to identify, categorize, and document requirements according to established engineering practices.

### 2.2 RAG-Grounded Training

The CET develops requirements expertise through Retrieval-Augmented Generation, where it learns to retrieve and synthesize information from curated requirements knowledge bases. This approach grounds the CET in professional standards and validated methodologies.

**Key Principle**: The RAG system retrieves relevant information from requirements corpora, and the CET learns to transform context that enables LLMs to generate requirements-expert responses supervised by multiple LLMs. Per Paper 00's "Fundamental CET Architecture Constraints," the CET transforms context only; all generation is performed by the downstream LLM ensemble.

### 2.3 RAG Knowledge Base Sources

Phase 1 training leverages standards, specifications, and real-world requirements documentation:

**Requirements Engineering Standards:**

- **IEEE 29148-2018**: Systems and software engineering — Life cycle processes — Requirements engineering
  - Defines stakeholder requirements, system requirements, software requirements
  - Process models for requirements elicitation, analysis, specification, validation
  - Requirements documentation structure and templates
  - Validation and verification methods

- **ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207**: Software life cycle processes
  - Requirements analysis processes
  - Requirements baseline management
  - Traceability and change management

- **SWEBOK (Software Engineering Body of Knowledge)**
  - Requirements fundamentals chapter
  - Requirements process guidance
  - Requirements analysis and specification techniques

**Requirements Classification Frameworks:**

```python
requirements_taxonomy = {
    'functional_requirements': {
        'definition': 'What the system must do',
        'examples': [
            'User authentication',
            'Data validation',
            'Report generation',
            'API endpoints'
        ],
        'specification_format': 'The system shall [action] when [condition]'
    },

    'non_functional_requirements': {
        'performance': 'Response time, throughput, resource usage',
        'scalability': 'User load, data volume handling',
        'reliability': 'Uptime, fault tolerance, recovery',
        'security': 'Authentication, authorization, encryption',
        'usability': 'User interface, accessibility',
        'maintainability': 'Code quality, documentation, testability'
    },

    'technical_requirements': {
        'dependencies': 'External libraries, frameworks, services',
        'data_models': 'Database schemas, data structures',
        'interfaces': 'APIs, protocols, data formats',
        'deployment': 'Infrastructure, configuration, environment'
    }
}
```

**Open Source Requirements Repositories:**

- **GitHub Requirements Documentation** (100+ applications)
  - Filter: Stars > 1000, has comprehensive README/docs

      - "PUT /tasks/{id} - Update task"
      - "DELETE /tasks/{id} - Delete task"
```

### 2.4 Multi-LLM Supervision

Multiple LLMs supervise the CET's requirements expertise development, providing diverse perspectives on requirement quality:

**LLM Team Composition** (see Paper 10: LLM Orchestra):
- **Premium APIs** (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini): Quality baseline for requirements validation
- **Together AI models** (Llama 3.1 70B, Qwen2.5): Diverse requirement extraction perspectives
- **Local models** (Llama 3.1 8B, CodeLlama 7B): High-volume generation for training data

**Supervision Process:**
1. CET retrieves relevant requirements standards from RAG knowledge bases
2. CET transforms application context, LLM generates requirements specification
3. Multiple LLMs evaluate requirement quality:
   - Completeness: Are all features captured?
   - Correctness: Do requirements match actual functionality?
   - Clarity: Are requirements unambiguous?
   - Traceability: Can requirements map to code sections?
4. Consensus scoring identifies areas for improvement
5. CET learns from high-agreement correct specifications

### 2.5 Data Volume and Diversity

**Estimated Training Data:**
- IEEE/ISO Standards: ~500 pages of requirements engineering guidance
- SWEBOK: ~100 pages requirements fundamentals
- GitHub applications: 100 applications with extracted requirements
- SRS templates: ~50 professional specification templates
- Academic examples: ~200 student/course SRS documents

**Application Coverage:**
- Primary: Python (100 applications for POC)
- Secondary: JavaScript/TypeScript, Go, Rust (future expansion)
- Domains: Web APIs, CLI tools, data processors, desktop applications

### 2.6 Training Data Preparation

**Preprocessing Pipeline:**

```python
class Phase1RequirementsDataPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = {
            'standards': IEEEStandardsLoader(),
            'applications': GitHubApplicationLoader(),
            'templates': SRSTemplateLoader(),
            'examples': AcademicExampleLoader()
        }
        self.rag_db = PostgresWithPgVector()  # See Paper 12

    def prepare_training_data(self):
        """Convert raw sources into RAG-ready format"""
        for source_name, loader in self.sources.items():
            raw_data = loader.fetch()
            processed = self.process_source(raw_data, source_name)
            self.rag_db.index(processed)

    def process_applications(self, apps):
        """Extract code + tests + docs for requirements analysis"""
        return [
            {
                'application_name': app['name'],
                'source_code': app['code'],
                'test_suite': app['tests'],
                'documentation': app['readme'],
                'dependencies': app['requirements_txt'],
                'complexity': self.analyze_complexity(app['code']),
                'embedding': self.embed(app['readme'] + app['code'])
            }
            for app in apps
        ]
```

### 2.7 RAG-Grounded Training Loop

```python
def phase1_requirements_training_step(cet, rag_db, llm_team):
    """Single training iteration for Phase 1 requirements expertise"""

    # Select application for requirements extraction
    application = sample_application()

    # CET retrieves relevant requirements standards and examples
    retrieved_docs = rag_db.retrieve(
        query=f"Extract requirements from {application['description']}",
        sources=['standards', 'templates', 'examples'],
        top_k=5
    )

    # CET transforms context, LLM generates requirements specification
    engineered_context = cet.transform_context(
        application_code=application['code'],
        application_tests=application['tests'],
        application_docs=application['docs'],
        retrieved_standards=retrieved_docs
    )
    cet_requirements = llm_team.generate_requirements(engineered_context)

    # Multi-LLM team evaluates requirements quality
    llm_evaluations = []
    for llm in llm_team:
        evaluation = llm.evaluate_requirements(
            application=application,
            extracted_requirements=cet_requirements,
            standards=retrieved_docs
        )
        llm_evaluations.append(evaluation)

    # Consensus scoring
    consensus = aggregate_evaluations(llm_evaluations)

    # Update CET based on feedback
    loss = compute_loss(cet_requirements, consensus)
    cet.update(loss)

    # Store conversation for Phase 2
    store_conversation(
        query=application,
        cet_output=cet_requirements,
        llm_feedback=consensus
    )
```

### 2.8 Phase 1 Output

**Deliverables for Phase 2:**
- 10,000+ conversation histories about requirements extraction
- Examples of good vs. poor requirements specifications
- Patterns of requirement identification from code, tests, and documentation
- Multi-LLM consensus on requirement quality criteria

**CET Capabilities After Phase 1:**
- Understands requirements engineering standards (IEEE, ISO)
- Can identify functional, non-functional, and technical requirements
- Recognizes requirement patterns in code and documentation
- Generates structured requirement specifications
- Applies requirements taxonomy consistently

## 3. Phase 2: Context Engineering Skills for Requirements

### 3.1 Objective

Teach the CET to transform varied input qualities into structured requirements context, learning to extract requirements from messy, incomplete, or vague sources.

**Training Goal**: Convert poor-quality inputs (incomplete docs, undocumented code, vague descriptions) into excellent requirements specifications.

### 3.2 Training on Quality Gradients

Using Phase 1 conversation histories, we create training pairs showing transformation from poor to excellent requirements:

```python
context_quality_pairs = {
    'poor_context': {
        'user_query': "Analyze this Python file",
        'code_snippet': "# 50 lines of undocumented code",
        'documentation': None,
        'tests': None
    },

    'excellent_context': {
        'functional_requirements': [
            "System shall validate user input before processing",
            "System shall return JSON responses for all API calls",
            "System shall log errors to stderr"
        ],
        'non_functional_requirements': {
            'performance': "Response time < 200ms",
            'reliability': "Input validation prevents crashes"
        },
        'technical_requirements': {
            'dependencies': ['flask', 'marshmallow'],
            'api_endpoints': ['GET /health', 'POST /process'],
            'data_validation': 'Marshmallow schemas'
        }
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Context Transformation Training

**Training Process:**

1. **Input Variation**: Present applications with varying documentation quality
   - Well-documented: Complete README, docstrings, comments
   - Partially documented: README only, no inline documentation
   - Undocumented: Code only, must infer from implementation

2. **Context Engineering**: Teach CET to:
   - Extract implicit requirements from code patterns
   - Infer non-functional requirements from implementation choices
   - Identify missing requirements by analyzing test cases
   - Structure findings according to standards

3. **Feedback Loop**: Compare CET output against Phase 1 supervised examples
   - Completeness check: Did CET find all requirements?
   - Accuracy check: Are extracted requirements correct?
   - Clarity check: Are requirements well-specified?

**Example Training Pair:**

```python
# Poor Context Input
poor_input = {
    'code': """
def process_data(data):
    if not data:
        return None
    return [x * 2 for x in data if x > 0]
""",
    'documentation': None
}

# Excellent Context Output (What CET Should Learn)
excellent_requirements = {
    'functional': [
        "System shall process numeric data arrays",
        "System shall filter out non-positive values",
        "System shall double remaining values"
    ],
    'non_functional': {
        'reliability': "System shall handle empty input gracefully",
        'validation': "System shall validate data exists before processing"
    },
    'technical': {
        'input_type': 'List[numeric]',
        'output_type': 'List[numeric] or None',
        'edge_cases': ['empty list', 'negative values', 'zero']
    }
}
```

### 3.4 Phase 2 Output

**Deliverables for Phase 3:**
- Context transformation patterns (poor → excellent)
- Requirements extraction strategies for various input qualities
- Quality assessment criteria for requirements specifications

**CET Capabilities After Phase 2:**
- Transforms incomplete information into structured requirements
- Extracts implicit requirements from code implementation
- Infers non-functional requirements from design choices
- Handles varying levels of documentation quality

## 4. Phase 3: Interactive Requirements Optimization Through Implementation Feedback

### 4.1 Objective

The critical phase where the CET learns through feedback loops with LLM implementation teams. The CET transforms context, LLMs generate requirements from that context, other LLMs attempt implementation, and code execution results provide learning signals.

**Training Goal**: Learn which requirement patterns lead to successful autonomous reconstruction.

### 4.2 The Requirements-Implementation Feedback Loop

```
User: "Extract requirements from Application A"
         ↓
CET: Transforms application into optimized context
         ↓
LLM: Generates Requirements Specification from context
         ↓
LLM Team: Attempts to implement from requirements
         ↓
Execution: Tests run on implementations
         ↓
Feedback: Which context patterns led to successful requirements?
         ↓
Learning Signal: Update CET weights
```

**Key Insight**: Requirements quality is measured by implementation success—if an LLM can reconstruct a working application from the requirements, the requirements are good.

### 4.3 Multi-LLM Implementation Diversity

**LLM Orchestra Configuration** (see Paper 10):

```python
phase3_llm_team = {
    'code_generators': [
        'llama3.1-70b-q4',      # General intelligence
        'deepseek-r1',          # Superior reasoning
        'codellama-70b',        # Code specialization
        'qwen2.5-coder-32b',    # Efficient coder
        'starcoder2-15b'        # Open source specialist
    ],

    'test_evaluators': [
        'codet5-large',         # Test understanding
        'graphcodebert',        # Code structure analysis
        'testing-llama-7b'      # Test generation specialist
    ]
}
```

**Why Multiple LLMs**: Different models interpret requirements differently, teaching the CET to write requirements that are:
- Unambiguous (all models interpret consistently)
- Complete (all models can implement successfully)
- Testable (test evaluators can validate)

### 4.4 Reconstruction Testing Methodology

**Validation Pipeline** (see Paper 04A for full details):

```python
def phase3_reconstruction_test(cet, application, llm_team):
    """Test if extracted requirements enable reconstruction"""

    # Step 1: CET transforms context, LLM generates requirements
    context = cet.transform_context(
        code=application.source_code,
        tests=application.test_suite,
        docs=application.documentation
    )
    requirements = llm_team['requirements_generator'].generate_requirements(context)

    # Step 2: LLM team implements from requirements
    implementations = []
    for llm in llm_team['code_generators']:
        implementation = llm.implement_from_requirements(
            requirements=requirements
        )
        implementations.append(implementation)

    # Step 3: Execute tests on implementations
    results = []
    for impl in implementations:
        test_result = execute_tests(
            implementation=impl,
            original_tests=application.test_suite
        )
        results.append(test_result)

    # Step 4: Calculate success metrics
    metrics = {
        'avg_test_pass_rate': mean([r.pass_rate for r in results]),
        'api_compatibility': check_api_compatibility(implementations, application),
        'functionality_match': compare_behavior(implementations, application),
        'best_implementation': max(results, key=lambda r: r.pass_rate)
    }

    # Step 5: Learning signal for CET
    if metrics['avg_test_pass_rate'] >= 0.75:
        reward = 1.0  # Good requirements
    else:
        # Analyze which requirements were missing/ambiguous
        missing_requirements = identify_missing_requirements(
            implementations=implementations,
            failed_tests=extract_failures(results)
        )
        reward = calculate_partial_reward(metrics)

    return metrics, reward, missing_requirements
```

### 4.5 Learning from Implementation Failures

**Failure Analysis:**

When implementations fail tests, the CET learns which requirements were:
1. **Missing**: Functionality present in original but not in requirements
2. **Ambiguous**: Different LLMs implemented differently
3. **Incorrect**: Requirements don't match actual behavior
4. **Incomplete**: Edge cases or error handling not specified

**Example Failure Pattern:**

```python
failure_case = {
    'requirement': "System shall validate user input",
    'problem': "Ambiguous - what constitutes 'valid'?",
    'failed_tests': [
        'test_rejects_negative_numbers',
        'test_rejects_non_numeric_input',
        'test_accepts_zero'
    ],
    'improved_requirement': """
        System shall validate user input according to:
        - Must be numeric type (int or float)
        - Must be non-negative (>= 0)
        - Zero is considered valid
        - Non-numeric input shall raise ValueError
    """
}
```

### 4.6 Phase 3 Training Loop

```python
def phase3_interactive_training(cet, applications, llm_team, iterations=10000):
    """Interactive training through reconstruction testing"""

    for iteration in range(iterations):
        # Sample application
        app = sample_application(applications)

        # CET transforms context, LLM generates requirements
        context = cet.transform_context(app)
        requirements = llm.generate_requirements(context)

        # Multiple LLMs implement
        implementations = parallel_implement(
            llm_team=llm_team,
            requirements=requirements
        )

        # Execute tests
        test_results = execute_tests(implementations, app.test_suite)

        # Calculate metrics
        pass_rate = mean([r.pass_rate for r in test_results])

        # Analyze failures if < 75% pass rate
        if pass_rate < 0.75:
            analysis = analyze_failures(
                requirements=requirements,
                implementations=implementations,
                test_results=test_results,
                original_app=app
            )

            # What requirements were missing/wrong?
            feedback = generate_feedback(analysis)
        else:
            feedback = "Requirements enabled successful reconstruction"

        # Update CET weights
        loss = reconstruction_loss(pass_rate, target=0.75)
        cet.update(loss, feedback)

        # Log progress
        log_metrics(iteration, pass_rate, requirements, feedback)
```

### 4.7 Phase 3 Success Metrics

**Target Outcomes:**
- 85% of applications achieve >75% test pass rate on reconstruction
- Average reconstruction test pass rate: >80%
- API compatibility: >90%
- Behavior equivalence: >85%

**Progression Tracking:**

```python
phase3_milestones = {
    'iteration_1000': {
        'avg_pass_rate': 0.45,
        'status': 'Learning basic requirement patterns'
    },
    'iteration_5000': {
        'avg_pass_rate': 0.65,
        'status': 'Capturing most functional requirements'
    },
    'iteration_10000': {
        'avg_pass_rate': 0.80,
        'status': 'Successful requirements extraction'
    }
}
```

### 4.8 Phase 3 Output

**Deliverables for Phase 4:**
- Validated requirements extraction patterns
- Understanding of requirement completeness criteria
- Patterns of requirement ambiguity that cause implementation failures
- Self-assessment capability (CET predicts if requirements are complete)

**CET Capabilities After Phase 3:**
- Generates requirements that enable >75% test pass reconstruction
- Identifies missing requirements through failure analysis
- Writes unambiguous, implementable specifications
- Predicts implementation success likelihood

## 5. Phase 4: Continuous Requirements Improvement in Production

### 5.1 Objective

During deployment, the CET continuously improves through self-critique and real-world feedback on the quality of context it engineers for requirements generation.

**Training Goal**: Refine context engineering based on production usage patterns and reconstruction success rates.

### 5.2 Self-Critique Mechanism

```python
class ProductionCET:
    def __init__(self, llm_team):
        self.llm_team = llm_team  # LLM ensemble that generates requirements

    def engineer_requirements_context_with_self_critique(self, application):
        """Production context engineering with self-assessment

        CET engineers and refines context; LLM generates requirements from context.
        """

        # Initial context engineering
        context_v1 = self.engineer_context(application)

        # LLM generates requirements from initial context
        requirements_v1 = self.llm_team.generate_requirements(context_v1)

        # Self-critique: Will this context lead to good requirements?
        self_assessment = self.critique_context(context_v1, requirements_v1)

        if self_assessment.confidence < 0.8:
            # Refine context based on critique
            context_v2 = self.refine_context(
                context_v1,
                concerns=self_assessment.issues,
                requirements_feedback=requirements_v1
            )
            # LLM generates improved requirements from refined context
            requirements_v2 = self.llm_team.generate_requirements(context_v2)
            return requirements_v2

        return requirements_v1

    def critique_context(self, context, generated_requirements):
        """Self-assess context quality by examining generated requirements"""
        concerns = []

        # Check if context enabled complete requirements
        if not generated_requirements.has_non_functional:
            concerns.append("Context missing signals for non-functional requirements")

        # Check if context led to ambiguous requirements
        ambiguous = self.identify_ambiguous_requirements(generated_requirements)
        if ambiguous:
            concerns.append(f"Context led to ambiguous requirements: {ambiguous}")

        # Check if context enabled testability
        if not generated_requirements.has_acceptance_criteria:
            concerns.append("Context missing signals for acceptance criteria")

        confidence = 1.0 - (len(concerns) * 0.2)
        return SelfAssessment(confidence, concerns)
```

### 5.3 Production Learning Loop

**Continuous Improvement Cycle:**

1. **Engineer Context**: CET analyzes production application and engineers optimized context
2. **Generate Requirements**: LLM generates requirements from CET context
3. **Self-Critique**: CET assesses whether its context enabled high-quality requirements
4. **Deploy for Reconstruction**: LLM-generated requirements used for actual modernization/documentation
5. **Monitor Success**: Track reconstruction test pass rates in production
6. **Update Weights**: If pass rate < expected, analyze context quality and improve

**Production Metrics:**

```python
production_metrics = {
    'contexts_engineered': 1000,  # CET engineered context for 1000 applications
    'requirements_generated': 1000,  # LLMs generated requirements from those contexts
    'avg_reconstruction_pass_rate': 0.82,
    'self_critique_accuracy': 0.89,  # How often self-critique predicts context quality
    'improvement_trend': '+5% per month',
    'failure_patterns': {
        'edge_cases': 'Most common miss',
        'error_handling': 'Second most common',
        'performance_requirements': 'Often implicit'
    }
}
```

### 5.4 Error Pattern Database

**Learning from Production Failures:**

The CET maintains a database of requirement patterns that led to failures:

```python
error_patterns_db = {
    'pattern_1': {
        'requirement': "System shall process requests quickly",
        'problem': "Vague performance requirement",
        'failure_rate': 0.45,
        'improved': "System shall respond within 200ms for 95th percentile"
    },

    'pattern_2': {
        'requirement': "System shall handle errors",
        'problem': "No specification of error types or handling",
        'failure_rate': 0.38,
        'improved': "System shall catch ValueError and return HTTP 400"
    }
}
```

### 5.5 Phase 4 Success Metrics

**Production Performance:**
- Self-critique accuracy: >85%
- Reconstruction pass rate improvement: +3-5% monthly
- Requirement completeness: >90%
- User satisfaction with extracted requirements: >4.0/5.0

### 5.6 Phase 4 Output

    'phase_1': {
        'llm_consensus_score': '>0.85',
        'requirements_coverage': '>90%',
        'standards_compliance': '>95%'
    },

    'phase_2': {

        'production_pass_rate': '>80%',
        'continuous_improvement': '+3% monthly'
    }
}
```

### 7.2 End-to-End Validation

**Test Set**: 20 held-out applications not seen during training

**Validation Protocol:**
1. CET transforms context from held-out application, LLM generates requirements
2. 5 LLMs implement independently from requirements
3. Execute original test suites on implementations
4. Measure: pass rate, API compatibility, behavior equivalence
5. **Success**: >75% average test pass rate across all applications

### 7.3 Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention

**Canary Application Set:**

To detect catastrophic forgetting during continuous training (Phase 4), we maintain a dedicated canary set of 10 applications that serve as regression indicators:

- **Size**: 10 high-quality applications (separate from 40 training and 10 hold-out)
- **Purpose**: Detect performance degradation on previously learned capabilities
- **Testing Frequency**: After every 1,000 training steps during Phase 4
- **Rotation Schedule**: Quarterly rotation to catch diverse regression patterns

**Canary Set Composition:**
```python
canary_set = {
    'web_apis': 2,           # REST/GraphQL services
    'cli_tools': 2,          # Command-line utilities
    'data_processors': 2,    # ETL/batch processing
    'microservices': 2,      # Service-oriented apps
    'real_time_systems': 2   # Event-driven systems
}
```

**Regression Detection Protocol:**

1. **Baseline Establishment**: Record performance on canary set after Phase 3 completion
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Test canary set every 1,000 steps during Phase 4
3. **Threshold Detection**: Trigger rollback if performance drops >5% on any canary app
4. **Root Cause Analysis**: Analyze which requirements categories show degradation
5. **Corrective Action**: Apply experience replay on affected categories

**Experience Replay Strategy:**

When regression is detected:
- Identify degraded capability (e.g., API documentation extraction)
- Retrieve 100 historical examples from that category
- Interleave with current training batch (20% historical, 80% new)
- Continue until canary performance recovers to baseline

**Quarterly Rotation:**

Every 3 months, rotate 3-4 canary applications to:
- Catch edge cases not represented in original set
- Prevent overfitting to specific canary apps
- Maintain fresh regression detection capabilities

This lightweight catastrophic forgetting prevention requires minimal overhead (<1% of training time) while providing strong safety guarantees for continuous learning.

### 7.4 RAG Baseline Comparison Methodology

*See Paper 01 Section 6.4 for complete three-baseline comparison framework*

To validate that learned requirements extraction (CET-D) outperforms traditional retrieval approaches, we implement a competitive RAG baseline:

**RAG Baseline Implementation:**

```python
rag_baseline = {
    'vector_database': 'pgvector',
    'embedding_model': 'text-embedding-3-large',
    'chunk_size': 512,
    'overlap': 128,
    'retrieval_k': 10,
    'reranking': 'cross-encoder-ms-marco'
}
```

**Indexing Strategy:**
- Index each of 40 training applications' complete codebase
- Chunk code files, documentation, and comments
- Create embeddings for semantic search
- Build per-application vector database

**Retrieval Process:**
1. Query: "Extract requirements from this application"
2. Retrieve top-10 relevant code chunks per application
3. Feed retrieved context to LLM for requirements generation
4. Compare reconstruction test pass rate vs. CET-D

**Head-to-Head Comparison:**

| Approach | Method | Expected Performance |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| CET-D | Learned context optimization for requirements | Target: >75% test pass rate |
| RAG Baseline | Vector retrieval + LLM generation | Expected: ~60% test pass rate |
| No Context | Direct LLM without context | Expected: ~40% test pass rate |
| Manual Gold | Human expert requirements | Expected: ~85% test pass rate |

**Statistical Validation:**
- Paired t-test across 40 training applications
- Null hypothesis: CET-D ≤ RAG baseline
- Significance: p < 0.05
- Power: 80% to detect 15% improvement

This rigorous comparison demonstrates whether learned context engineering provides measurable improvement over established retrieval-augmented approaches.

## 8. Comparison to Code Generation Approach

### 8.1 Why Requirements-First is Superior

| Aspect | Code Generation | Requirements-First |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Validation** | Subjective quality | Objective reconstruction testing |
| **Subject Scope** | All of programming | Requirements engineering standards |
| **Success Metric** | "Is code good?" | "Do tests pass?" |
| **Training Data** | Hard to validate | Standards-based |
| **Practical Utility** | Direct generation | Enables modernization + generation |

### 8.2 Advantages

1. **Objective Validation**: Test pass rates are unambiguous
2. **Clearer Training Signals**: Implementation success/failure is concrete feedback
3. **Practical Applications**: Requirements extraction enables legacy modernization
4. **Scalable Evaluation**: Automated reconstruction testing at scale
5. **Standards-Based**: Professional engineering practices as foundation

## 9. Future Directions

### 9.1 Expansion to More Languages

Current: Python (100 applications)
Future: JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java (500+ applications each)

### 9.2 Domain-Specific Requirements

Current: General software applications
Future: Web services, embedded systems, data pipelines, ML systems

### 9.3 Multi-Modal Requirements

Current: Code + tests + docs
Future: UI screenshots, user behavior logs, database schemas

## 10. Conclusion

This four-phase progressive training methodology, specialized for requirements engineering, provides a clear path from foundational expertise to production-ready requirements extraction. By focusing on requirements rather than direct code generation, we achieve:

1. **Objective validation** through reconstruction testing
2. **Clear success metrics** via test pass rates
3. **Practical utility** for legacy modernization
4. **Scalable training** with automated feedback loops

The methodology transforms the CET from a general transformer into a specialized requirements engineering expert, capable of engineering context that enables LLMs to generate comprehensive, implementable specifications achieving >75% reconstruction success rates.

**Key Takeaway**: Requirements engineering provides a more tractable, objectively measurable training domain than direct code generation, while still demonstrating sophisticated context engineering capabilities.

## Appendix A: Future Synthetic Data Validation Plan

While our proof-of-concept uses only real-world applications (50 carefully selected apps with high test coverage), scaling beyond 500 applications may require synthetic data augmentation. This appendix outlines our planned validation approach for future synthetic data use.

### A.1 When Synthetic Data Becomes Necessary

**Current Approach (50 apps):** 100% real-world applications, manual validation feasible

**Year 2 (500 apps):** Semi-automated validation, primarily real apps with targeted synthetic augmentation

**Year 3+ (3,000+ apps):** Automated filtering, synthetic data for rare edge cases

### A.2 Synthetic Data Quality Validation

**Multi-Level Validation Strategy:**

1. **Round-Trip Consistency:**
   - Generate synthetic requirements → reconstruct application → extract requirements again
   - Measure semantic similarity between original and extracted requirements
   - Reject if similarity < 90%

2. **Human Adversarial Testing:**
   - Sample 10% of synthetic data for expert human review
   - Have reviewers identify "clearly synthetic" vs. "plausibly real"
   - Reject batches where >30% flagged as obviously synthetic

3. **Distributional Matching:**
   - Compare synthetic data distributions to real data across:
     - Requirements length distribution
     - Complexity metrics (cyclomatic, coupling, cohesion)
     - API surface area patterns
     - Test coverage characteristics
   - Reject synthetic batches with KL-divergence > 0.15 from real distribution

4. **Cross-Validation with Real Data:**
   - Train model on 90% real + 10% synthetic
   - Test on 100% real hold-out set
   - Compare to 100% real baseline
   - Accept synthetic data only if performance within 2% of pure-real baseline

### A.3 Synthetic Data Generation Methodology

**LLM Ensemble Approach:**

```python
synthetic_generation = {
    'requirement_generators': ['GPT-4', 'Claude Opus', 'Gemini 2.5 Pro'],
    'consensus_threshold': 2/3,  # 2 of 3 must agree
    'quality_filters': [
        'implementable',
        'testable',
        'unambiguous',
        'complete'
    ]
}
```

**Diversity Enforcement:**
- Ensure synthetic data covers underrepresented categories
- Prevent mode collapse by monitoring requirement pattern diversity
- Rotate generating LLMs to avoid systematic biases

### A.4 Limitations and Risks

**Known Risks:**
- Synthetic data may reflect LLM training biases
- Edge cases might be under-represented
- Real-world messiness difficult to replicate
- Risk of "teaching to the test" if validation LLM overlaps with generator

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Maintain at least 70% real data even at scale
- Use synthetic data only for augmentation, not primary training
- Continuous monitoring of real-world performance
- Periodic re-validation against new real applications

**Acceptance Criteria:**

Synthetic data will only be used if:
1. Real data availability insufficient for category
2. All four validation checks pass
3. Performance on real hold-out set unaffected
4. Human experts cannot reliably detect synthetic vs. real

This conservative approach ensures synthetic data enhances rather than degrades training quality.

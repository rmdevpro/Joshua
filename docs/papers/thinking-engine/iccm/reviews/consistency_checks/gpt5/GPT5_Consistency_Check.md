Below is a consolidated consistency review across the master document and all 14 ICCM papers. For each issue, I list the paper, location (section/heading), the problematic quote, why it conflicts with the CET Architecture Clarification, and a concrete correction.

Global guidance (applies to all papers)
- Problem pattern: “CET generates/extracts/produces requirements/code/docs/specs” or “CET-generated code/requirements”
- Why it’s wrong: Per the Architecture Clarification, CETs only generate context. LLMs generate requirements, code, documentation, specifications, and any final outputs.
- Fix templates:
  - Replace “CET-generated code/requirements/specs” with “LLM-generated [artifact] from CET-optimized context”
  - Replace “CET extracts requirements” with “CET engineers context that enables LLMs to generate requirements”
  - Replace functions/method names implying generation (e.g., generate_X, extract_Y) with context roles (e.g., prepare_X_context, identify_Y_signals, build_X_context, surface_Y_features)

Master document (00_Master_Document_v3)
- No conflicts. This document correctly enforces constraints and should be cited as the source of truth.

Paper 01: 01_ICCM_Primary_Paper_v4
1) Section 7.2 (CET-D Proof of Concept: Software Development Domain)
- Quote: “Code generation: Target >80% syntactically correct output”
- Issue: Ambiguous — implies CET generates code.
- Correction: “Code generation (by LLMs with CET-optimized context): Target >80% syntactically correct output”

Paper 02: 02_Progressive_Training_Methodology_v4
1) Abstract
- Quote: “Our approach transforms deployed applications into comprehensive requirements...”
- Issue: Ambiguous; suggests CET/system generates requirements.
- Correction: “Our approach transforms deployed applications into optimized context for requirements generation... (LLMs generate requirements from this context.)”

2) Section 4.8 (Phase 3 Output — CET Capabilities After Phase 3)
- Quote: “Generates requirements that enable >75% test pass reconstruction”
- Issue: CET must not generate requirements.
- Correction: “Generates optimized requirements context that enables LLMs to generate requirements achieving >75% reconstruction pass rates”

3) Section 5.1 (Self-Critique Mechanism — class ProductionCET)
- Quotes:
  - “def extract_requirements_with_self_critique(...)”
  - “requirements_v1 = self.extract(application)”
  - “requirements_v2 = self.refine_requirements(...)”
- Issue: Method names and flow imply CET generates and refines requirements.
- Correction:
  - Rename to “def engineer_requirements_context_with_self_critique(...)”
  - “context_v1 = self.engineer_context(application)”
  - “context_v2 = self.refine_context(...)”
  - After refining context: LLM generates requirements from this context (explicitly show LLM call)

4) Multiple sections (general phrasing)
- Quote examples: “requirements extraction,” “CET extracts requirements”
- Issue: Risk of implying CET performs extraction/generation.
- Correction: Use “requirements-focused context engineering” / “context that enables requirements generation by LLMs”

Paper 03: 03_CET_Architecture_Specialization_v3
1) Section 9 (Evaluation Framework — evaluate_cet_d)
- Quote: “‘code_quality’: evaluate_generated_code(cet_d)”
- Issue: Implies CET-D generates code.
- Correction: “‘code_quality’: evaluate_llm_generated_code_with(cet_d_context)” or “‘code_quality’: evaluate_code_generated_with_cet_d_context”

Paper 04A: 04A_Code_Execution_Feedback_v3
- No CET-generation violations found. The pipelines show LLMs generating requirements/implementations. Keep as is.

Paper 04B: 04B_Production_Learning_Pipeline_v3
1) Section 5 (Requirements Refinement Loop — RequirementsRefinementEngine.__init__)
- Quote: “def __init__(self, requirements_db, cet_model):”
- Issue: Ambiguous; suggests CET model might directly refine requirements.
- Correction: Use “llm_orchestrator” (or “llm_team”) instead of “cet_model”, making it explicit that LLMs generate/refine text while CET only learns from outcomes. For example: “def __init__(self, requirements_db, llm_orchestrator):”

2) Section 5 (RequirementsRefinementEngine.refine_requirements)
- Quote: The engine “applies improvements” and returns “refined_requirements”
- Issue: Not explicit that LLM generates the refined requirements; CET should not.
- Correction: Add explicit LLM call for refinement: “refined_requirements = llm_orchestrator.rewrite_requirements(improvement_prompts, original_requirements, cet_context)” Ensure CET’s role is to produce/refine context and learn from outcomes.

3) Section 5.2 (ProductionFeedbackTrainer)
- Quote: “def fine_tune_from_production(self, training_samples, epochs=3):”
- Issue: This is fine (CET training), but ensure no implied requirement generation inside this class.
- Correction: None needed, but verify all “generation” is attributed to LLMs (training/feedback OK for CET).

Paper 05: 05_CET_D_Requirements_Engineering_Implementation_v4
1) Section 4.1 (Context Engineering for Behavioral Requirements — class BehavioralContextEngineer)
- Quotes (method names):
  - “generate_user_story(...)”
  - “generate_use_case(...)”
  - “generate_gherkin_scenarios(...)”
- Issue: These names and returned artifacts are requirements; CET must not generate them.
- Corrections:
  - Rename to:
    - “prepare_user_story_context(...)” (produce story prompts, examples, acceptance criteria templates — not final stories)
    - “derive_use_case_features(...)” (assemble contextual elements needed for LLM to write use cases)
    - “build_gherkin_scenario_context(...)” (produce scenario cues/templates, not finished Gherkin)
  - In code comments, clarify: “Returns context scaffolds/templates for LLM generation; LLM generates the final [story/use case/scenarios].”

2) Section 4.2 (Non-Functional Requirements Extraction — class NonFunctionalRequirementsExtractor)
- Quotes:
  - “extract_nonfunctional_requirements(...)” and nested “extract_performance_requirements(...)”, etc.
  - The methods return requirement specifications with “shall...”
- Issue: These are final NFRs; CET must not generate them.
- Corrections:
  - Rename to:
    - “identify_nonfunctional_signals(...)”
    - “surface_performance_evidence(...)”, “surface_security_indicators(...)”, etc.
  - Outputs should be “context_evidence/context_clues/context_templates” that LLM uses to generate NFRs.
  - Add comments: “Returns structured context signals/templates; LLM writes the NFRs.”

3) Section 5.1 (IEEE 29148-2018 Format)
- Quote: “class IEEE29148RequirementsGenerator: def generate_srs(...)”
- Issue: CET generating SRS violates constraints.
- Correction: Rename class and method to:
  - “class SRSContextBuilder: def prepare_srs_context(...)” that produces organized context aligned to IEEE sections; LLM then generates the SRS.

Paper 06: 06_Requirements_Validation_Through_Reconstruction_Testing_v3
- No CET-generation violations found (LLMs implement from requirements). Keep as is.

Paper 07A: 07A_Self_Bootstrapping_Development_v3 (future work)
This paper repeatedly attributes code/tool/test generation to CET-D. All such instances must be reframed to “LLM-generated artifacts using CET-D optimized context.” Provide a global caveat at the start of the paper that any “Generated by CET-D” comments in code should be read as “Generated by LLMs from CET-D-optimized context,” and update the code comments and function names accordingly.

1) Section 3.1 (Tool Generation Pipeline — CETToolGenerator)
- Quote: “generated_code = self.cet_d.generate_code(context)”
- Issue: CET-D must not generate code.
- Correction: “generated_code = llm_ensemble.generate_code(context)” (CET-D prepares context; LLM ensemble generates code).

2) Many code examples include comments like:
- “Generated by CET-D on 2024-03-15” (ContextQualityAnalyzer, CETPipelineProfiler, CETErrorAnalyzer, ContextPairGenerator, ContextCompressionMetric)
- Issue: Misattributes generation to CET-D.
- Correction: Change to “Generated by LLMs from CET-D-optimized context on [date]” or remove “Generated by CET-D” entirely.

3) Section 4 (Automated Feature Implementation — Example feature)
- Quote: “Auto-fixed by CET-D” and code blocks of implemented features
- Issue: Assigns feature implementation to CET-D.
- Correction: “Auto-fixed by LLMs using CET-D-optimized context.” Ensure all code blocks and narrative reflect LLM generation guided by CET context.

4) Global phrasing in the paper
- Quotes: “CET-D generates development tools,” “CET-D successfully implemented features,” “CET-D creates comprehensive test suites”
- Issue: Conflicts with constraints.
- Correction: “The system (LLM ensemble) generates [tools/features/tests] using CET-D-optimized context.” Where metrics are reported, attribute generation to LLMs, not CET.

Paper 07B: 07B_Continuous_Self_Improvement_v3 (future work)
This paper also attributes code generation and fixes to CET-D. All such instances must be reframed similarly to 07A.

1) Section 2 (Performance Optimization — CETPerformanceOptimizer)
- Quotes:
  - “def generate_optimization(...)” returns optimized code
  - “validation compares original vs optimized code”
- Issue: CET shouldn’t generate optimized code.
- Correction: “CET builds optimization context; LLM ensemble generates candidate optimized variants.” Rename methods accordingly (e.g., “build_optimization_context(...)” and “request_optimized_variants_via_llm(...)”).

2) Section 3.3 (Automated Fix Generation — class AutomatedFixGenerator)
- Quote: “secure_code = self.cet_d.generate_secure_alternative(context)”
- Issue: CET must not generate code.
- Correction: “secure_code = self.llm_ensemble.generate_secure_alternative(context)”

3) Examples marked “Auto-fixed by CET-D”
- Issue: Misattribution.
- Correction: “Auto-fixed by LLMs from CET-D-optimized context.”

4) Section 4 (Documentation Generation)
- Issue: Multiple places show code/doc generation attributed to CET.
- Correction: “LLM-generated documentation from CET-optimized context” — update class names/methods/comments accordingly.

5) Section 5 (Architectural Evolution)
- Issue: Refactoring recommendations and code changes appear as CET-driven changes.
- Correction: “CET identifies/refines context for refactoring opportunities; LLMs propose code-level refactors based on that context.”

Paper 08: 08_Test_Lab_Infrastructure_v3
- No CET-generation conflicts (infrastructure only). Keep as is.

Paper 09: 09_Containerized_Code_Execution_for_Small_Labs_v3
- No CET-generation conflicts (execution framework only). Keep as is.

Paper 10: 10_Testing_Infrastructure_v3
1) Section 1.1 (Introduction — The Quality Assurance Challenge)
- Quote: “Context-Engineered Transformers (CETs) generate code that must meet production-grade quality standards.”
- Issue: CETs don’t generate code.
- Correction: “LLMs generate code when provided CET-optimized context, and that code must meet production-grade quality standards.”

2) Section 1.1 (later sentences)
- Quote: “Unlike traditional software development where testing validates human-written code, CET-generated code requires...”
- Issue: Again attributes generation to CET.
- Correction: “...LLM-generated code (from CET-optimized context) requires...”

3) Scan for “CET-generated code” anywhere else in this paper
- Fix to “LLM-generated code from CET-optimized context”

Paper 11: 11_Conversation_Storage_Retrieval_v3
- No CET-generation conflicts. Using fields like messages.context_engineered is consistent with CET’s role. Keep as is.

Paper 12: 12_Conversation_Storage_Retrieval_v3
- No CET-generation conflicts beyond the above. Keep as is.

Paper 13: 13_Bidirectional_Processing_v3 (Future Directions)
This paper proposes CETs post-processing LLM outputs (reverse pass), which can blur the “context only” boundary if CET directly modifies final content. To maintain alignment with the clarification while keeping the future direction:

1) Sections 1.3/2.1/2.2 and code showing reverse_pass modifying outputs
- Issue: As written, CET appears to adapt/remove/insert text directly; that’s content generation/modification.
- Correction: Reframe reverse pass as “response adaptation context generation”:
  - CET produces adaptation guidance/context (policies, constraints, personalization parameters, QA checks).
  - A small LLM (or rule-based adapter) applies the adaptation using this context.
  - Update code: replace direct string edits by CET with calls to “llm_adapter.apply(response, adaptation_context)”.
  - Add a clear disclaimer near the start: “In this future vision, CETs continue to generate only context. Actual response adaptation is performed by a lightweight LLM adapter using the CET-provided adaptation context.”

2) Sections 4/8 (Error Correction, Hallucination Prevention, Consistency Enforcement)
- Issue: CET directly edits responses.
- Correction: “CET identifies issues and generates adaptation context; the adapter LLM applies edits using that context.” Update method names and comments accordingly.

3) Section 7 (Computational Trade-offs — latency)
- Update prose to reflect that adaptation is performed by an adapter LLM (or deterministic transformer) guided by CET; CET overhead is context generation only.

Paper 14: 14_Edge_CET_P_v3
- No CET-generation conflicts. It focuses on privacy-preserving personal context on device. Keep as is.

Summary of the most critical fixes to make first
- Papers 07A and 07B (future work): Replace all “Generated by CET-D” (and similar) with “Generated by LLMs from CET-D-optimized context,” and adjust function names/comments accordingly. These papers currently contain the largest number of violations.
- Paper 05: Rename methods/classes that indicate CET generates requirements artifacts (user stories, SRS, NFRs); change to context scaffolds/evidence/templates; clearly state LLMs generate the final requirements.
- Paper 10: Fix “CET-generated code” to “LLM-generated code from CET-optimized context” in the Introduction and anywhere else it appears.
- Paper 02: Fix “Generates requirements” phrasing and the self-critique method names to “engineer/refine context” and keep LLM generation explicit.
- Paper 13 (future): Add the explicit “adapter LLM” layer for reverse-pass; CET generates adaptation context only.

Spot-check examples of corrected phrasing
- Before: “CET-D generates user stories and acceptance criteria.”
  After: “CET-D prepares user-story context and acceptance-criteria templates; LLMs generate the user stories and acceptance criteria.”
- Before: “CET extracts requirements from the application.”
  After: “CET engineers requirements-focused context from the application; LLMs generate requirements from that context.”
- Before: “CET-generated code must pass all tests.”
  After: “LLM-generated code (from CET-optimized context) must pass all tests.”

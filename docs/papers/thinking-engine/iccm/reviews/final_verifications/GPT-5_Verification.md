Summary verdict

- Core rule 1 (CETs generate ONLY context): Pass, with a few future-work papers needing wording and API/name cleanups.
- Core rule 2 (LLMs generate ALL outputs): Pass, substance is correct everywhere; one code path needs a fix.
- Core rule 3 (Names reflect context engineering, not content generation): Mostly pass; several method/class names in the self‑bootstrapping/continuous‑improvement drafts should be renamed to avoid implying CETs generate code.

Paper-by-paper consistency check (14)

1) Paper 00 (Master/ICCM main) – Pass
- Consistently states CET = context-only; LLMs generate outputs.

2) Paper 01 (Progressive Training Methodology) – Pass
- Forward loop shows cet.transform_context; LLMs produce requirements/code.

3) Paper 02 (CET Architecture Specialization) – Pass
- CET-P/T/D presented as context preprocessors; LLM generates responses.

4) Paper 03 (Interactive Learning Code Feedback) – Pass
- Training loop: CET → context; LLMs generate, tests/eval produce learning signal.

5) Paper 04 (CET-D Software Implementation / Requirements specialization) – Pass
- All requirement generation is explicitly via LLMs; CET returns contexts (behavioral, NFR, IEEE SRS context).

6) Paper 05 (Automated Validation/Requirements Reconstruction Testing) – Pass
- Framework evaluates LLM implementations; CET not generating outputs.

7) Paper 06A (Self-Bootstrapping Development, future work) – Needs fixes
- Substance: examples correctly mark “Generated by LLM from CET‑D context.”
- Issues:
  - Wording implies CET-D “generates tools/features/tests.” Please change to “LLMs generate from CET-D’s engineered context.”
  - Method/class names imply generation (see below).
- Recommended changes:
  - Rename CETToolGenerator.generate_tool → prepare_tool_generation_context (and keep LLM generation call as-is).
  - Rename FeatureImplementationPipeline → FeatureGenerationOrchestrator; ComponentGenerator.generate_component → prepare_component_context (call LLM to generate).
  - Replace headings “Self-generated tool” → “LLM-generated tool (from CET-D context).”
  - Throughout, replace “CET-D has successfully implemented features” → “LLMs implemented features from CET-D context.”

8) Paper 06B (Continuous Self-Improvement, future work) – Needs fixes
- Substance mostly correct (LLM generates code from CET context). One code path violates rule 1/2:
  - In AutomatedRemediation.remediate_vulnerability: secure_code = self.cet_d.generate_secure_alternative(context) violates context-only. Fix to:
    - secure_code = self.llm_orchestrator.generate_secure_alternative(context); CET prepares the “secure alternative” context only (e.g., prepare_secure_alternative_context).
- Naming cleanups:
  - AutomatedFixGenerator.generate_fix → prepare_fix_context (LLM then generates fixes).
  - DocumentationGenerator.generate_function_doc returns context; ensure the method still calls llm_ensemble.generate_documentation(doc_context) and adjust text to “LLM generates docs from CET context.”
  - Any “CET-D generates X” phrasing → “LLM generates X from CET-D context.”

9) Paper 07 (Test Lab Infrastructure) – Pass
- Pure infra; no content generation by CET.

10) Paper 08 (Containerized Execution) – Pass
- Pure infra; no content generation by CET.

11) Paper 09 (LLM Orchestra) – Pass
- Explicitly about orchestrating LLMs to generate outputs; CETs not generating outputs.

12) Paper 10 (Testing Infrastructure) – Pass (minor naming suggestion)
- Framework coordinates testing of LLM-generated code.
- If “CETTestGenerator” appears (as in examples), prefer TestGenerationOrchestrator (to avoid implying CETs generate tests). Ensure any test code creation that isn’t deterministic/scaffolded is delegated to LLMs with CET-provided context.

13) Paper 11 (Conversation Storage and Retrieval) – Pass
- Data infra only.

14) Paper F01 (Bidirectional Processing, future direction) – Pass
- Architecture note correctly enforces CET generates adaptation context only; “adapter LLM” applies adaptations. Methods like prepare_personalization_context are purely context; adapter_llm.adapt_response modifies outputs.

15) Paper F02 (Edge CET-P, future direction) – Pass
- CET-P stays context-only on-device; cloud/local LLMs generate and adapt outputs based on sanitized context.

Specific issues to fix (with proposed changes)

A) Language that implies CET generates outputs (requirements, code, tools, tests)
- Where: Paper 06A (multiple places), 06B (several places), and a few headings/comments.
- Fix: Replace with “LLMs generate [requirements/code/tests/docs] from CET-engineered context.” Keep code comments that already read “Generated by LLM from CET-D-optimized context.”

B) Method/class names that imply content generation (rename to context/orchestration)
- CETToolGenerator.generate_tool → prepare_tool_generation_context
- FeatureImplementationPipeline → FeatureGenerationOrchestrator
- ComponentGenerator.generate_component → prepare_component_context
- AutomatedFixGenerator.generate_fix → prepare_fix_context (LLM then generates the fix)
- Any CET* class that suggests code generation (“generator”) → “Orchestrator” or “ContextBuilder” if it only builds context.
- In Testing Infrastructure examples, “CETTestGenerator” → “TestGenerationOrchestrator” (and ensure LLM produces any non-mechanical test code).

C) One functional violation to correct (code path)
- Paper 06B, AutomatedRemediation.remediate_vulnerability:
  - Current: secure_code = self.cet_d.generate_secure_alternative(context)
  - Correct: secure_context = self.cet_d.prepare_secure_alternative_context(vulnerability, code); secure_code = self.llm_orchestrator.generate_secure_alternative(secure_context)

D) Consistency nits (optional but recommended)
- Ensure all code comments use “Generated by LLM from CET‑[P/T/D] context” when showing generated artifacts.
- In 06A/06B metrics sections (e.g., “Average generation time”), explicitly attribute to the LLM team (“LLM average generation time…”).

Confirmations

- CETs generate ONLY context:
  - Confirmed across all core and infra papers; future papers 06A/06B/wording now aligned with recommended edits. Bidirectional paper explicitly limits reverse pass to “adaptation context,” with an adapter LLM applying changes.

- LLMs generate ALL outputs:
  - Confirmed. Requirements, code, fixes, tests, documentation, SRS all come from LLMs. The one noted code path (06B remediation) needs the single-line correction above.

- Names reflect context engineering role:
  - Mostly yes. Implement the recommended renames in 06A/06B (+ optional in Paper 10 examples) to eliminate generation‑implication in CET method/class names.

Net result after fixes

- Architecture remains clean and consistent: CETs are small, specialized context engineers; all content is produced by LLMs; reverse processing uses an adapter LLM guided by CET-provided adaptation context.
- Papers 06A/06B remain labeled as future work; language and APIs will now match the core constraints.
- No other architectural inconsistencies found.

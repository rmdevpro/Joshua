# Checkpoint Process - Saving Work State

## Overview
At major checkpoints (completing a feature, end of session, before restart), follow this process to ensure all work is properly saved and recoverable.

---

## When to Checkpoint

**Trigger a checkpoint when:**
- âœ… Completing a major feature or milestone
- âœ… End of work session
- âœ… Before restarting Claude Code
- âœ… After resolving a critical bug
- âœ… Before switching to a different project/task

---

## Checkpoint Steps

### Step 1: Update CURRENT_STATUS.md

**What to update:**
- Last Updated timestamp
- Recent Achievements section
- Project Components Status table
- Next Steps section

**Location:** `/mnt/projects/Joshua/CURRENT_STATUS.md`

**Example:**
```markdown
## Last Updated: 2025-10-10

## Recent Achievements
### MAD V1 Architecture Documentation (2025-10-10)
- Completed corrected v2 with architectural fixes
- Generated 4 professional charts
- 100% triplet approval achieved
```

---

### Step 2: Update Project Documentation (if pertinent)

**Update relevant documentation:**
- Component README.md (usage, installation, features)
- Architecture documents (if design changed)
- Requirements documents (if specs changed)
- Configuration examples
- API documentation
- Troubleshooting guides

**Common locations:**
- `/mnt/projects/Joshua/mads/[component]/README.md`
- `/mnt/projects/Joshua/architecture/`
- `/mnt/projects/Joshua/mads/[component]/requirements/`
- `/mnt/projects/Joshua/knowledge-base/`

**Example updates:**
- Added new feature â†’ Update component README with usage
- Fixed architecture issue â†’ Update architecture docs
- Changed requirements â†’ Update requirements doc
- Discovered solution â†’ Add to knowledge-base

---

### Step 3: Check Git Status

**See what files changed:**
```bash
sshpass -p "Edgar01760" ssh aristotle9@192.168.1.210 "cd /mnt/projects/Joshua && git status"
```

**Verify documentation is included:**
- Check that README/docs are staged
- Ensure no untracked important files

---

### Step 4: Update GitHub Issues (if pertinent)

**When to update issues:**
- Bug fixed â†’ Close issue with `fixes #N` in commit
- Feature completed â†’ Close issue
- Progress made â†’ Add comment to issue
- New bug found â†’ Create issue

**Commands:**
```bash
# List open issues
sshpass -p "Edgar01760" ssh aristotle9@192.168.1.210 "cd /mnt/projects/Joshua && gh issue list"

# Close issue
sshpass -p "Edgar01760" ssh aristotle9@192.168.1.210 "cd /mnt/projects/Joshua && gh issue close N"

# Create issue
sshpass -p "Edgar01760" ssh aristotle9@192.168.1.210 "cd /mnt/projects/Joshua && gh issue create --title 'Title' --body 'Description'"
```

---

### Step 5: Commit and Push to Git

**Commit message format:**
```
Brief summary line (50 chars max)

Detailed description:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Any breaking changes

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

**Commands:**
```bash
# Add files
sshpass -p "Edgar01760" ssh aristotle9@192.168.1.210 "cd /mnt/projects/Joshua && git add [files]"

# Commit with heredoc message
sshpass -p "Edgar01760" ssh aristotle9@192.168.1.210 "cd /mnt/projects/Joshua && git commit -m \"\$(cat <<'EOF'
Your commit message here

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

EOF
)\""

# Push
sshpass -p "Edgar01760" ssh aristotle9@192.168.1.210 "cd /mnt/projects/Joshua && git push origin main"
```

---

### Step 6: Backup CLAUDE.md (if modified)

**If CLAUDE.md was edited during this session:**

**Run backup script:**
```bash
/mnt/projects/Joshua/config/backup_claude_md.sh
```

**Update CHANGELOG:**
- Edit `/mnt/projects/Joshua/config/CLAUDE.md.versions/CHANGELOG.md`
- Document what changed and why

**Commit backup:**
```bash
sshpass -p "Edgar01760" ssh aristotle9@192.168.1.210 "cd /mnt/projects/Joshua && git add config/CLAUDE.md.versions/ && git commit -m 'CLAUDE.md backup: [description]' && git push"
```

**See:** `/mnt/projects/Joshua/processes/CLAUDE_MD_Maintenance.md` for details

---

### Step 7: Backup Sessions to Godot (if restart required)

**If Claude Code restart is imminent, backup last 24 hours:**

**Find recent sessions:**
```bash
ls -lht ~/.claude/projects/-home-aristotle9/*.jsonl | head -10 | awk '{print $NF, $6, $7}'
```

**Store each session:**
```
mcp__iccm__godot_conversation_store_messages_bulk
  messages_file: /host/home/aristotle9/.claude/projects/-home-aristotle9/[SESSION-ID].jsonl
  metadata: {"source": "claude_code", "session_date": "2025-10-10", "topic": "work_description"}
```

**Save conversation IDs returned for recovery.**

## Checkpoint Checklist

Use this checklist at each checkpoint:

- [ ] CURRENT_STATUS.md updated
- [ ] Project documentation updated (README, architecture, requirements, KB)
- [ ] Git status checked
- [ ] Relevant files committed
- [ ] GitHub issues updated/closed
- [ ] Changes pushed to remote
- [ ] (If CLAUDE.md modified) Backup created and committed
- [ ] (If restart needed) Last 24h sessions backed up to Godot
- [ ] Conversation IDs saved for recovery

---

## Quick Checkpoint (Minor Changes)

For small updates that don't warrant full checkpoint:

1. Update CURRENT_STATUS.md (optional)
2. Commit and push to git
3. Skip issues/session backup

---

## Example: Full Checkpoint Workflow

**Scenario:** Completed MAD V1 Architecture V2, about to restart

**Steps:**
1. âœ… Updated CURRENT_STATUS.md with completion details
2. âœ… Checked git status - 18 files changed
3. âœ… No GitHub issues to update (new feature, not bug fix)
4. âœ… Committed with detailed message about architectural corrections
5. âœ… Pushed to GitHub (commit bdc76cb)
6. âœ… Backed up 5 sessions from last 3 days to Godot
7. âœ… Saved conversation IDs: `8e83f1b7...`, `ed79a557...`, etc.

**Result:** All work preserved, can safely restart Claude Code

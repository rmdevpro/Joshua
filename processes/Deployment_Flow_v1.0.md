# Deployment Flow v1.0

**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Related**: Multi-Agent Development Flow v1.0

---

## Overview

A structured deployment process for code validated through Multi-Agent Development Flow. Uses Blue/Green deployment strategy, automated testing, trio-based code review for bugs, and user acceptance testing.

---

## Purpose

Deploy code safely to production after validating against:
- Requirements (Phase 1 output)
- Implementation quality (Phase 2 output)
- Test coverage (Phase 3 output)

---

## Inputs

**Required from Software Development Lifecycle:**
1. **Code**: Implementation from Phase 2 (Multi-Agent Development Flow)
2. **Requirements**: Specification from Phase 1 (Multi-Agent Development Flow)
3. **Tests**: Test suite from Phase 3 (MAD-Test)

**Additional Inputs:**
- Deployment configuration (environment variables, secrets, ports)
- Infrastructure specifications (docker-compose, Dockerfile, etc.)
- Rollback plan

---

## Deployment Flow

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation
```
Driver prepares inputs:
  - Code (from dev cycle)
  - Requirements (from dev cycle)
  - Tests (from test cycle)
  - Deployment config
  ↓
Deploy to Green (Blue stays running)
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All inputs present and accessible
- Green environment deployed
- Blue environment still running (safety net)

---

### Phase 2: Fix Loop
```
[FIX LOOP]
Driver tries reasonable fixes
  ↓
Stuck?
  ↓
If YES → Consult Senior Member
  ↓
Really stuck?
  ↓
If YES → Consult Trio
  ↓
Redeploy to Green
  ↓
Running?
  ↓
If NO → Continue Fix Loop
If YES → Proceed to Test Loop
[END FIX LOOP]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Green environment running without crashes
- Basic functionality operational
- Ready for testing

**Fix Strategy:**
- Start with reasonable fixes Driver can make
- Escalate to Senior Member when stuck
- Escalate to Trio for major issues
- Redeploy and verify after each fix
- Repeat until service is running

**Note**: Almost nothing "just works" on first deployment. This loop is expected and normal.

---

### Phase 3: Test Loop
```
[TEST LOOP]
Driver runs test suite against Green
  ↓
Tests pass?
  ↓
If NO → Back to Fix Loop
If YES → Proceed to Full Code Review
[END TEST LOOP]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests execute
- All tests pass
- No errors in test output

**Test Execution:**
- Unit tests (if available)
- Integration tests (if available)
- Service health tests
- Manual validation if test suite not complete

**Note**: Fix Loop → Test Loop → Fix Loop iteration continues until all tests pass.

---

### Phase 4: Full Code Review
```
[REVIEW LOOP]
Driver sends to Trio (via Fiedler):
  - Deployed code
  - Original requirements
  - Test results
  ↓
Trio reviews code against requirements
  ↓
Driver sends to Senior Member
  ↓
Senior Member synthesizes review
  ↓
Driver sends to Junior Members
  ↓
Junior Members review
  ↓
Major flaws found?
  ↓
If YES → May need to return to Development Flow
If NO → Reasonable fixes needed?
  ↓
If YES → Back to Fix Loop → Test Loop → Full Code Review again
If NO → Consensus reached (code good + requirements met)
[END REVIEW LOOP]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Trio consensus: code is good
- All requirements met
- No major flaws
- Ready for production

**Review Focus:**
- Code quality meets standards
- Requirements fully implemented
- Security considerations addressed
- Performance acceptable
- No critical issues

**Decision Points:**
- **Major flaws**: Fundamental design issues → Return to Development Flow
- **Reasonable fixes**: Minor issues, bugs, improvements → Back to Fix Loop
- **Consensus**: Code approved, requirements met → Proceed to completion

---

### Phase 5: Completion
```
Promote Green to production
  ↓
Shutdown Blue environment
  ↓
Driver updates documentation and GitHub
  ↓
Deployment Complete
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Green promoted to production
- Blue safely shut down
- Documentation updated
- GitHub issues closed

**Completion Actions:**
1. Promote Green (rename container, update routing if needed)
2. Stop and remove Blue environment
3. Update documentation:
   - Deployment notes
   - Test results summary
   - Issues encountered and resolutions
4. Update GitHub:
   - Close related issues (with `fixes #N`)
   - Update affected docs
   - Commit and push changes

---

## Rollback Procedure

**When to Rollback:**
- Green environment won't stabilize after reasonable fixes
- Major flaws discovered requiring Development Flow restart
- User requests rollback

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Keep Blue running (it never stopped)
2. Stop Green environment
3. Document reason for rollback
4. Determine next steps:
   - Minor fixes: Retry deployment with fixes
   - Major issues: Return to Development Flow

---

## Success Metrics

**Deployment Quality:**
- All tests pass
- Trio consensus achieved
- Requirements fully met
- Green stable in production

**Deployment Efficiency:**
- Time from start to completion
- Number of Fix Loop iterations
- Trio review outcome (consensus vs. major flaws)

---

## Integration with Multi-Agent Development Flow

**Inputs from MAD:**
- Phase 1 MAD → Requirements document
- Phase 2 MAD → Implementation code
- Phase 3 MAD-Test → Test suite

**Feedback to MAD:**
- Deployment issues may trigger new dev cycle
- Test failures inform code quality
- Requirements gaps inform next iteration

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated rollback triggers** based on metrics
2. **Canary deployments** (gradual traffic shift)
3. **Integration with monitoring/alerting** systems
4. **Automated performance regression** detection
5. **Multi-environment support** (staging, production, etc.)

---

**Status**: v1.0 - Ready for use (with manual testing until MAD-Test implemented)
**Dependencies**: Multi-Agent Development Flow v1.0, MAD-Test (Issue #3)

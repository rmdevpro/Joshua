# Deployment Flow v1.0

**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Related**: Multi-Agent Development Flow v1.0

---

## Overview

A structured deployment process for code validated through Multi-Agent Development Flow. Uses Blue/Green deployment strategy, automated testing, trio-based code review for bugs, and user acceptance testing.

---

## Purpose

Deploy code safely to production after validating against:
- Requirements (Phase 1 output)
- Implementation quality (Phase 2 output)
- Test coverage (Phase 3 output)

---

## Inputs

**Required from Software Development Lifecycle:**
1. **Code**: Implementation from Phase 2 (Multi-Agent Development Flow)
2. **Requirements**: Specification from Phase 1 (Multi-Agent Development Flow)
3. **Tests**: Test suite from Phase 3 (MAD-Test)

**Additional Inputs:**
- Deployment configuration (environment variables, secrets, ports)
- Infrastructure specifications (docker-compose, Dockerfile, etc.)
- Rollback plan

---

## Deployment Flow

### Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Preparation
```
Driver prepares inputs:
  - Code (from dev cycle)
  - Requirements (from dev cycle)
  - Tests (from test cycle)
  - Deployment config
  ↓
Driver validates inputs complete
  ↓
Driver creates Blue/Green deployment plan
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All inputs present and accessible
- Deployment config validated
- Blue/Green strategy defined
- Rollback plan documented

---

### Phase 2: Blue/Green Deployment
```
Driver deploys to Green environment
  (existing Blue environment remains active)
  ↓
Driver verifies Green container/service started
  ↓
Driver runs health checks on Green
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Green environment deployed successfully
- Service starts without errors
- Health checks pass
- Blue environment still running (safety net)

**Blue/Green Strategy:**
- **Blue**: Currently running production code
- **Green**: New code being deployed/tested
- **Switch**: Only after Green fully validated
- **Rollback**: Switch back to Blue if issues found

---

### Phase 3: Automated Testing
```
Driver runs test suite against Green environment
  ↓
Tests pass?
  ↓
If NO → Proceed to Bug Fix Loop
If YES → Proceed to Requirements Validation
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All tests execute
- All tests pass
- No errors in test output
- Test coverage meets threshold

**Test Execution:**
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- Service health tests
- Any custom tests from test suite

---

### Phase 4: Bug Fix Loop (if tests fail)
```
[LOOP START]
Driver collects test failures and logs
  ↓
Driver sends to Trio (via Fiedler)
  ↓
Trio analyzes failures and generates fixes
  ↓
Driver sends to Senior Member
  ↓
Senior Member synthesizes fix + notes
  ↓
Driver reviews & rates (Quality, Completeness, Drift)
  ↓
Driver sends to Junior Members
  ↓
Junior Members review fix
  ↓
Driver reviews & rates Junior performance
  ↓
Consensus? (2/2 approve)
  ↓
If YES → Deploy updated code to Green, re-run tests
If NO → Loop (max 3 iterations)
  ↓
Tests pass after fix?
  ↓
If YES → EXIT LOOP to Requirements Validation
If NO and loop count ≤ 3 → CONTINUE LOOP
If NO and loop count > 3 → STOP, escalate to user
[LOOP END]
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Bugs identified and fixed
- Tests pass after fix
- Fix reviewed by Junior Members (2/2 approval)
- No drift from requirements

**Stop Conditions:**
- Max 3 fix iterations → Escalate to user
- Fundamental issue with code → Escalate to user
- Fix causes requirements drift → Stop and consult

---

### Phase 5: Requirements Validation
```
Driver sends to Trio:
  - Deployed code
  - Original requirements
  - Test results
  - Deployment logs
  ↓
Trio reviews code against requirements
  ↓
Driver sends to Senior Member
  ↓
Senior Member synthesizes validation + notes
  ↓
Driver evaluates: Requirements met?
  ↓
If NO → Document gaps, consult user (may need new dev cycle)
If YES → Proceed to UAT
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All requirements addressed in deployed code
- No missing functionality
- No scope creep
- Implementation matches specification

**Validation Focus:**
- Functional requirements met
- Non-functional requirements met (performance, security, etc.)
- Edge cases handled
- Error handling present

---

### Phase 6: User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
```
Driver presents to user:
  - Deployed Green environment details
  - Test results
  - Requirements validation
  - How to access/test
  ↓
User tests Green environment
  ↓
User acceptance?
  ↓
If NO → Document issues, may trigger new dev cycle or bug fix
If YES → Proceed to Production Promotion
```

**Success Criteria:**
- User has access to Green environment
- User validates functionality
- User accepts deployment
- Any user concerns documented

**UAT Checklist:**
- Core functionality works as expected
- Performance acceptable
- UI/UX acceptable (if applicable)
- No critical issues found
- User explicitly approves

---

### Phase 7: Production Promotion
```
Driver switches traffic from Blue to Green
  (Green becomes new production)
  ↓
Driver monitors for issues (5-10 minutes)
  ↓
Issues detected?
  ↓
If YES → Rollback to Blue immediately
If NO → Proceed to Blue Shutdown
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Traffic successfully switched to Green
- No errors in logs
- Service responding normally
- Monitoring confirms stability

**Promotion Steps:**
1. Update routing/proxy to point to Green
2. Monitor logs and metrics
3. Verify Blue is still running (for rollback)
4. Wait for stability period (5-10 min)

---

### Phase 8: Blue Shutdown & Documentation
```
Driver confirms Green stable
  ↓
Driver stops Blue environment
  ↓
Driver updates documentation:
  - Deployment notes
  - Test results
  - Any issues encountered
  - Performance baselines
  ↓
Driver updates GitHub:
  - Close related issues
  - Update affected docs
  - Commit deployment notes
  - Push to GitHub
  ↓
Deployment Complete
```

**Success Criteria:**
- Blue safely shut down
- Documentation updated
- GitHub issues closed
- Deployment notes committed
- Team notified

**Documentation Requirements:**
- Deployment timestamp
- Code version/commit hash
- Test results summary
- Any issues encountered and resolutions
- Performance metrics
- Rollback instructions (for future reference)

---

## Rollback Procedure

**Trigger Conditions:**
- Tests fail after max iterations (3)
- Requirements not met
- User rejects in UAT
- Issues detected after promotion

**Rollback Steps:**
1. Switch traffic back to Blue
2. Stop Green environment
3. Document reason for rollback
4. Analyze failure (may consult Trio)
5. Determine next steps (fix and retry, or new dev cycle)

---

## Stop Conditions & Escalation

**Driver stops deployment and escalates to user when:**
- Test failures exceed 3 fix iterations
- Requirements validation fails
- User rejects in UAT
- Critical issues found after promotion
- Fundamental code issues requiring redesign

**Escalation Process:**
1. Driver documents issue clearly
2. Driver presents options (rollback, fix, new cycle)
3. User decides path forward
4. Driver executes user decision

---

## Success Metrics

**Deployment Quality:**
- All tests pass
- Requirements fully met
- User acceptance achieved
- Zero production issues in first 24 hours

**Deployment Efficiency:**
- Time from start to production
- Number of bug fix iterations
- Rollback frequency
- User acceptance rate

---

## Integration with Multi-Agent Development Flow

**Inputs from MAD:**
- Phase 1 MAD → Requirements document
- Phase 2 MAD → Implementation code
- Phase 3 MAD-Test → Test suite

**Feedback to MAD:**
- Deployment issues may trigger new dev cycle
- Test failures inform code quality
- Requirements gaps inform next iteration

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Automated rollback triggers** based on metrics
2. **Canary deployments** (gradual traffic shift)
3. **Integration with monitoring/alerting** systems
4. **Automated performance regression** detection
5. **Multi-environment support** (staging, production, etc.)

---

**Status**: v1.0 - Ready for use (with manual testing until MAD-Test implemented)
**Dependencies**: Multi-Agent Development Flow v1.0, MAD-Test (Issue #3)

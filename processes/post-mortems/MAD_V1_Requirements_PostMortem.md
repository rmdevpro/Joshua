# MAD V1 Requirements - Development Cycle Post-Mortem

**Date:** 2025-10-10
**Process:** Multi-Agent Development Flow v1.0
**Driver:** Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)
**Trio:** Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1
**GitHub Issue:** #9

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed requirements generation for 13 MAD V1 components using the Multi-Agent Development Flow. Reached consensus (2/2 approval) after 1 iteration. Key learning: Initial rejection (0/2) was due to scope confusion - junior members evaluated requirements with design-phase expectations. Re-contextualization resolved the issue without requiring synthesis changes.

---

## Process Timeline

### Phase 1: Trio Generation (Parallel)
- **Task:** Generate 1-page requirements for each of 13 MADs
- **Models:** Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4 Turbo (failed - token limit), GPT-4o (replacement), DeepSeek R1
- **Duration:** ~2 minutes
- **Result:** 3 independent requirement sets
  - DeepSeek: Concise bullet-point format
  - Gemini: Comprehensive structured format
  - GPT-4o: Brief overview format (partial coverage)

### Phase 2: Senior Member Synthesis
- **Senior Member:** Gemini 2.5 Pro
- **Task:** Synthesize trio outputs into unified requirements
- **Duration:** ~1.5 minutes
- **Result:** Comprehensive 1-page requirements for all 13 MADs
- **Quality:** High - well-structured, consistent format, implementable

### Phase 3: Junior Review (First Attempt)
- **Junior Members:** GPT-4o, DeepSeek R1
- **Result:** **REJECTED (0/2)**
- **Issue:** Scope confusion - both reviewers applied design-phase expectations to requirements document
- **GPT-4o feedback:** General issues with completeness, detail level
- **DeepSeek R1 feedback:** Detailed line-items requesting design-level specs

### Phase 4: Re-Contextualization
- **Action:** Clarified "1-page requirements" scope vs "design document" scope
- **Key Message:** "The next step is design docs - detailed architecture belongs there"
- **Result:** Both reviewers immediately understood and re-evaluated

### Phase 3 (Repeat): Junior Re-Review
- **Result:** **APPROVED (2/2)** ✅
- **GPT-4o:** "Successfully adheres to expectations for requirements phase"
- **DeepSeek R1:** "All 13 MADs stay within scope of 1-page requirements"
- **No changes to synthesis required**

## Performance Ratings

### Trio Performance

**Gemini 2.5 Pro (Senior Member):** 9/10
- ✅ Excellent synthesis quality
- ✅ Consistent structure across all 13 MADs
- ✅ Preserved open questions appropriately
- ⚠️ No issues - synthesis approved without modification

**GPT-4o (Junior Member):** 7/10
- ✅ Thoughtful initial review (though misdirected)
- ✅ Quick course correction after re-contextualization
- ⚠️ Initial scope confusion led to rejection
- ✅ Final approval with clear rationale

**DeepSeek R1 (Junior Member):** 8/10
- ✅ Extremely detailed feedback (both times)
- ✅ Systematic evaluation approach
- ⚠️ Initial feedback was design-focused, not requirements-focused
- ✅ Final approval showed strong understanding of requirements scope

### Driver Performance (Self-Assessment): 6/10
- ✅ Successfully orchestrated all phases
- ✅ Correctly diagnosed scope confusion issue
- ⚠️ **CRITICAL ERROR:** Should have provided scope context in Phase 3 initial review prompt
- ⚠️ Cost 1 full iteration cycle (could have been avoided)
- ✅ Effective re-contextualization strategy

## Quality Assessment

### Final Requirements Document

**Completeness:** 10/10
- All 13 MADs covered
- Consistent format (Overview, FRs, TRs, Out of Scope, Success Criteria)
- Open questions appropriately flagged

**Clarity:** 9/10
- Clear functional requirements
- Well-defined success criteria
- Some technical requirements could be slightly more explicit (but appropriate for requirements phase)

**Implementability:** 9/10
- Ready for design phase
- Dependencies clearly identified
- Scope boundaries well-defined

**Overall Quality:** 9/10 - Excellent requirements document suitable for design phase

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Trio diversity:** Three different approaches (concise, comprehensive, brief) provided good coverage
2. **Gemini as senior member:** Strong synthesis capabilities, consistent output
3. **Re-contextualization strategy:** Simple clarification resolved 0/2 rejection without rework
4. **Parallel generation:** Phase 1 efficiency - 3 independent outputs in ~2 minutes

### What Didn't Work
1. **Initial scope guidance:** Driver failed to provide clear "requirements vs design" context in Phase 3 prompt
2. **GPT-4 Turbo failure:** Token limit issue required fallback to GPT-4o (minor delay)
3. **Wasted iteration:** Could have achieved 2/2 approval in first review cycle

### Critical Insight
**The problem wasn't the synthesis - it was the review context.** The synthesis was correct from the start. The rejection happened because reviewers were given the task "review these requirements" without being reminded "this is a 1-page requirements doc, not a design doc." Once reminded, both approved immediately.

## Recommendations

### For Future Requirements Cycles

1. **Explicit scope framing in every prompt:**
   - Phase 1: "Generate 1-page requirements (not design docs)"
   - Phase 3: "Review as requirements document - design details come next"
   - Include examples of what belongs in requirements vs design

2. **Pre-review calibration:**
   - Before Phase 3, send reviewers a brief "requirements vs design" guideline
   - Reference the original task statement in review prompts

3. **Driver vigilance:**
   - Anticipate scope confusion when transitioning between phases
   - Don't assume context carries forward implicitly

### For Design Phase (Next Step)

1. **Leverage approved requirements:**
   - Use these as the authoritative scope definition
   - Open questions (helper MCP architecture, data access patterns) are design priorities

2. **Expected trio composition:**
   - Same trio worked well for requirements
   - Consider same roles (Gemini senior, GPT-4o/DeepSeek junior) for consistency

3. **Process improvements:**
   - Apply lesson learned: explicit scope framing in all prompts
   - Expect design documents to be larger (~3-5 pages per MAD)

---

## Metrics

- **Total Duration:** ~15 minutes (including re-contextualization)
- **Iterations:** 1 (plus 1 unnecessary due to scope confusion)
- **Consensus:** 2/2 approval
- **Drift:** Minimal - synthesis stayed true to original requirements
- **Rework:** None required (synthesis unchanged)
- **Token Usage:** ~75K tokens total

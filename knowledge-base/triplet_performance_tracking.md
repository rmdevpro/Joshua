# Triplet AI Performance Tracking

## Purpose

Track the quality of responses from each AI model (Fiedler's default models to identify underperformers and optimize the triplet composition.

**Goal:** Swap out low-performing models for better alternatives (e.g., Claude Opus, DeepSeek-R1 via Together.AI)

---

## Quality Metrics

For each triplet response, score on 1-5 scale:

### 1. **Accuracy** (Paper Alignment)
- 5: Perfectly aligned with research papers, all citations correct
- 4: Mostly accurate, minor misinterpretations
- 3: Some inaccuracies, needs correction
- 2: Significant misunderstandings
- 1: Contradicts papers or invents information

### 2. **Completeness** (Coverage)
- 5: Addresses all questions, finds edge cases we missed
- 4: Covers all requested items thoroughly
- 3: Covers most items, misses some details
- 2: Incomplete, missing significant portions
- 1: Minimal coverage, unusable

### 3. **Insight Quality** (Value-Add)
- 5: Exceptional insights, identifies critical issues we didn't see
- 4: Strong insights, valuable perspective
- 3: Solid analysis, no special insights
- 2: Surface-level analysis only
- 1: No meaningful insights

### 4. **Practical Feasibility** (Implementation Awareness)
- 5: Understands constraints, proposes realistic solutions
- 4: Mostly practical, minor unrealistic suggestions
- 3: Mix of practical and impractical
- 2: Often unrealistic given constraints
- 1: Ignores constraints, impractical suggestions

### 5. **Synthesis Utility** (Ease of Integration)
- 5: Well-structured, easy to synthesize with others
- 4: Clear structure, minor reformatting needed
- 3: Usable but requires significant reorganization
- 2: Difficult to integrate with other responses
- 1: Format incompatible, hard to use

## Swap Candidates for Grok 4

If Grok 4 continues underperforming (avg <15/25 after Phase 1 and 2):

**Top Candidates:**
1. **Claude Opus** ($15/M) - Premium reasoning, excellent for architecture work
2. **Claude Sonnet** ($3/M) - More affordable, still very strong
3. **DeepSeek-R1** (pricing TBD) - Strong reasoning, competitive performance
4. **Llama 3.1 405B** ($3.50/M via Together.AI) - Largest open model

**Recommendation:** If Grok 4 scores <15/25 in Phase 1, consider Claude Sonnet ($3/M) as cost-effective replacement.

## Swap History

*None yet - tracking begins with Phase 0*

## Notes

- **Phase 0 Results:** Gemini and GPT-5 tied at perfect 25/25, Grok 4 severely underperformed at 11/25
- **Critical Findings:** Both Gemini and GPT-5 caught the fundamental "CET generates context only" issue
- **Budget Issue:** GPT-5 uniquely identified hardware budget inconsistency (scope lists too much hardware for $7,840)
- **Grok 4 Concern:** Minimal engagement, failed to follow format, missed critical issues - **MONITOR CLOSELY**
- **Next Steps:** Track Grok 4 in Phase 1 and 2; if still underperforming, swap for Claude Sonnet

# Systematic Debug Procedure

**Purpose:** Prevent going in circles. Follow this process for EVERY bug.

---

## üîÑ Standard Process (4 Steps)

### Step 1: Find the Issue
- Gather evidence systematically
- Document what's working vs. what's broken
- Identify the exact failure point
- Update BUG_TRACKING.md with findings

### Step 2: Diagnose & Propose Fix
- Analyze root cause
- Propose specific fix (code changes, config changes, etc.)
- Document proposed fix in BUG_TRACKING.md
- Do NOT attempt fix yet

### Step 3: Verify Fix with 3 LLMs
- Send fix proposal to 3 LLMs via Fiedler:
  - Gemini 2.5 Pro
  - GPT-5
  - Llama 3.3 70B (or Grok-4)
- Get confirmation/corrections from each
- Document LLM feedback in BUG_TRACKING.md

### Step 4: Attempt Fix
- Apply the verified fix
- Test the fix
- Document results in BUG_TRACKING.md
- If successful: Mark bug resolved, update RESUME_HERE.md
- If failed: Return to Step 1 with new evidence

# Paper 00: IDE (Intelligent Decision Engineering) - Master Document Outline

**Version:** Draft for Council of Elders Review
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** OUTLINE - Awaiting Council Synthesis
**Repository:** Joshua (IDE discipline within MAD ecosystem)
**Purpose:** Complete the Trinity (ICCM + IDE + MAD) by defining decision engineering components of MAD Thinking Engine

## Context for Council of Elders

You are being asked to review and expand this outline into a comprehensive Paper 00 for the **IDE (Intelligent Decision Engineering)** discipline. This completes the trinity of foundational papers:

1. **ICCM Paper 00** ✅ (Context Engineering → CET component)
2. **IDE Paper 00** ⏳ (Decision Engineering → Rules Engine + DER components) ← YOU ARE HERE
3. **MAD Paper 00** ✅ (Agentic Engineering → Complete agent assembly)

**Key Architectural Facts:**
- IDE produces the **Rules Engine** and **DER (Decision Engineering Recommender)** components
- These are components #2 and #3 of the MAD Thinking Engine
- The complete MAD Thinking Engine = CET (from ICCM) + Rules Engine (from IDE) + DER (from IDE) + State Manager
- MADs communicate via **conversations** (not "service calls")
- MADs provide **capabilities** (not "services")
- Half-MADs (Fiedler, Dewey, etc.) have minimal Thinking Engines; Full MADs (Hopper, Grace) have complete ones
- Fiedler MAD provides LLM Orchestra capability (multi-model consultation) that any MAD can access

**Your Task:**
Review this outline and produce a comprehensive Paper 00 for IDE that:
1. Defines the discipline of Intelligent Decision Engineering
2. Specifies the Rules Engine and DER components in detail
3. Explains how these integrate with CET (from ICCM) in the MAD Thinking Engine
4. Proposes a hierarchical paper structure (like MAD Paper 00 did)
5. Provides implementation roadmap, metrics, and publication strategy

## Proposed Outline Structure

### Executive Summary
- IDE defines the decision-making discipline within the MAD ecosystem
- Produces Rules Engine (deterministic) + DER (synthesis) components of Thinking Engine
- Bridges symbolic AI (rules, logic) with modern LLM-based probabilistic reasoning
- Enables transparent, auditable, controllable decision-making in AI agents

### 1. Introduction: The Decision Problem in AI Agents

#### 1.1 Why Decision Engineering Matters
- Traditional AI agents: Opaque decision-making, poor auditability
- Need for hybrid approaches: Rules for known scenarios, models for novel situations
- Decision Engineering as formal discipline

#### 1.2 The IDE Discipline
- **Input:** Structured context (from CET), world state, task requirements
- **Output:** Actionable decisions/recommendations with confidence and reasoning trace
- **Core Innovation:** Synthesis of deterministic rules, probabilistic models, and context

#### 1.3 The Trinity of Disciplines
| Discipline | Repository | Output | Role in MAD |
|------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
| ICCM | ICCM | CET | Context engineering (Thinking Engine component 1) |
| IDE | Joshua | Rules Engine + DER | Decision engineering (Thinking Engine components 2-3) |
| MAD | Joshua | Complete agents | Agent assembly (Thinking + Doing + State Manager) |

#### 1.4 Document Organization
- This Paper 00 defines the complete IDE discipline
- Hierarchical paper structure for detailed topics
- Relationship to ICCM and MAD papers

### 2. Theoretical Foundation

#### 2.1 Decision Engineering Principles
- **Transparency:** Every decision must be explainable
- **Auditability:** Full reasoning trace preserved
- **Controllability:** Known scenarios follow deterministic rules
- **Adaptability:** Novel scenarios leverage probabilistic models
- **Confidence:** Explicit uncertainty quantification

#### 2.2 Hybrid Decision Architecture
- **Rules Engine:** Fast, deterministic, transparent for known scenarios
  - Decision trees, business logic, security policies
  - Symbolic reasoning, formal verification
  - Predictable, auditable outputs

- **DER (Decision Engineering Recommender):** Synthesis for complex/ambiguous scenarios
  - Integrates rule outputs, context (from CET), and optional LLM Orchestra consultation
  - Probabilistic reasoning when rules insufficient
  - Confidence scoring and reasoning trace generation

#### 2.3 Decision Flow in MAD Thinking Engine
```
Input → CET (context engineering) → Rules Engine (deterministic check)
                                   ↓
                            DER (synthesis) ← Optional: LLM Orchestra consultation
                                   ↓
                            Final Decision → Doing Engine
```

#### 2.4 Relationship to Existing Decision Systems
- Classical AI: Expert systems, production rules (CLIPS, Drools)
- Modern AI: Neural decision networks, reinforcement learning
- Hybrid: SOAR (production rules + chunking), ACT-R (declarative + procedural)
- IDE Innovation: Tight integration with CET, explicit DER synthesis step, MAD ecosystem

### 3. Architecture Components

#### 3.1 Rules Engine Specification
- **Input:** Structured context from CET, world state
- **Processing:** Match rules against context, evaluate conditions
- **Output:** Rule matches with confidence, or "no match" signal
- **Implementation Approaches:**
  - Decision trees (scikit-learn, XGBoost)
  - Production rule systems (CLIPS, Drools)
  - Formal logic (Prolog, Answer Set Programming)
  - Policy engines (OPA, Cedar)

#### 3.2 DER (Decision Engineering Recommender) Specification
- **Input:**
  - CET-transformed context
  - Rules Engine output (matches or no-match)
  - World state from State Manager
  - Task requirements
- **Processing:**
  - If Rules Engine has high-confidence match → Use rule output
  - If ambiguous/novel → Consult LLM Orchestra (via Fiedler MAD conversation)
  - Synthesize inputs into coherent recommendation
  - Generate confidence score and reasoning trace
- **Output:**
  - Actionable decision/recommendation
  - Confidence score (0-1)
  - Reasoning trace (for auditability)
  - Fallback options (if confidence low)

#### 3.3 Integration with CET (ICCM)
- CET provides structured, optimized context as input to Rules Engine and DER
- DER may request CET re-transformation if context insufficient for decision
- Feedback loop: Decision outcomes inform future CET context engineering

#### 3.4 Integration with LLM Orchestra (Fiedler MAD)
- DER initiates conversation with Fiedler MAD when probabilistic reasoning needed
- Fiedler returns multi-model consultation results
- DER synthesizes model outputs with rules and context
- Not all decisions require LLM Orchestra (rules sufficient for many cases)

### 4. Hierarchical Paper Structure

Proposed paper structure for IDE discipline (to be refined by Council):

**Act 1 - Foundations:**

### 7. Relationship to ICCM and MAD

#### 7.1 ICCM → IDE Boundary

```

### 9. Research Questions for Council

Please address these questions in your Paper 00 synthesis:

1. **Rules Engine Design:** What rule representation is most suitable for MAD Thinking Engines? (Decision trees, production rules, formal logic, or hybrid?)

6. **Formal Verification:** Can we formally verify that Rules Engine satisfies safety properties?

7. **Paper Structure:** Is the proposed 13-paper structure appropriate? Should it be condensed or expanded?

8. **Novel Contributions:** What makes IDE novel vs existing decision systems (expert systems, hybrid AI, etc.)?

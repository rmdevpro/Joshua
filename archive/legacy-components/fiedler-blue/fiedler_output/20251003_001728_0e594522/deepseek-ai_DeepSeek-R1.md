Hmm, the user is asking "What is 2+2?" and wants the answer in one word. This seems like a very basic math question, almost too simple. 

I wonder if this is a test or a joke? The user might be checking if I can follow instructions precisely by giving a one-word response. Or perhaps they're just having fun with a straightforward question. 

The answer is obviously 4, but I need to make sure I deliver it in the exact format requested. No explanations, no extra words - just the numerical answer. 

The user seems to be in a playful mood given the simplicity of the question. I'll keep it light and respond with just the number as instructed. 

"Four" would technically be one word, but "4" is more direct and mathematical. Either would satisfy the requirement, but the numeral feels more appropriate for a math answer. 

Alright, simple question deserves a simple answer. I'll go with "4".

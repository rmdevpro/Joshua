We are given that the Gates MCP server is running and connected to the relay, and the relay shows it as healthy with 3 tools. However, when trying to call one of the tools (e.g., `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`), we get "No such tool available". Other backends (Fiedler, Dewey, Playfair) are working.

Constraints: We cannot restart the relay or modify it without approval. Therefore, we must focus on the Gates implementation.

What we know:
- The Gates container is running on port 9050.
- The relay shows Gates as connected and healthy, and it lists the three tools.
- The issue is specific to Gates.

What we have tried:
1. Changing the serverInfo.name from "gates-mcp-server" to "gates" and restarting the Gates container.
2. Restarting the Gates container.
3. Using `relay_reconnect_server("gates")` (presumably a function to tell the relay to reconnect to the Gates server).
4. Verified Gates in backends.yaml (which is likely the relay's configuration).

Given that the relay shows the tools, it means that during registration, the Gates server successfully advertised the tools to the relay. However, when the relay tries to route a call to one of these tools, it fails with "No such tool available".

Possible reasons:

1. **Tool Name Mismatch**: The tool names that the Gates server registered might not match what the relay is expecting. The relay expects tools in the format `mcp__iccm__<tool_name>`. The Gates server might be registering the tools without the `mcp__iccm__` prefix? But note that the relay shows the tools as `gates_create_document`, `gates_validate_markdown`, `gates_list_capabilities`. So the relay is adding the `gates_` prefix? How does the relay form the full tool name?

   Typically, the relay forms the tool name as:
   `mcp__iccm__<backend_name>_<tool_name>`

   So for Gates, the backend name is "gates", and the tool name as provided by the Gates server might be "create_document", "validate_markdown", "list_capabilities". Then the relay would form:
   - `mcp__iccm__gates_create_document`
   - `mcp__iccm__gates_validate_markdown`
   - `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`

   However, the evidence says the relay shows the tools as `gates_create_document`, etc. without the `mcp__iccm__` prefix? Or is that just the base name? The error message when calling is for `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`.

   The issue might be that the Gates server is registering the tools with the full name including the prefix? Then the relay would be forming a name that is too long? For example, if the Gates server registers a tool named "mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities", then the relay would try to form `mcp__iccm__mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`? That would be wrong.

   The server should only register the base tool name (e.g., "list_capabilities") and the relay adds the backend prefix and the MCP prefix.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: The tool names might be case sensitive. Check if the Gates server is registering the tools in a different case than what the relay expects.

3. **Relay Configuration**: Although we cannot change the relay, we can check the backends.yaml to see if there is any difference in the configuration of Gates compared to the others. For example, is there a `prefix` setting for Gates that might be causing the tool names to be formed differently?

4. **Gates Server Implementation**: The Gates server might be misreporting the tool names during registration. We should check the code where the Gates server registers the tools.

5. **Network Issue**: There might be a network issue that causes the relay to lose connection to the Gates server after registration? But the relay shows it as healthy.

6. **Relay Caching Issue**: The relay might have cached an old state of the Gates server? But we tried reconnecting and restarting the container.

Given the constraints, we must focus on the Gates server. Let's think about what might be different in the Gates server compared to the others.

What to check in the Gates implementation:

1. **Tool Registration**: How does the Gates server register its tools? It should be sending a list of tool names (without any prefix) to the relay during the handshake. Check the code that builds the list of tools. Make sure the tool names are exactly as expected (e.g., "create_document", "validate_markdown", "list_capabilities") and that there are no extra spaces or characters.

2. **Server Name**: We changed the serverInfo.name to "gates". This name must match the name in the relay's backends.yaml. Since the relay shows the backend as "gates", that seems correct. But note: the relay uses this name to form the tool names. So if the server name in the relay is "gates", then the tool names become `mcp__iccm__gates_<tool_name>`. 

   However, if the Gates server, when registering, is using a different name (like "gates-mcp-server") in the handshake, then the relay would form the tool names with that name. But we changed it to "gates". So we must ensure that the name used in the handshake is exactly "gates".

3. **Handshake Process**: The Gates server must implement the MCP server protocol correctly. The relay expects a `ServerInfo` message upon connection. The `ServerInfo` message should contain:
   - `name`: the name of the backend (should be "gates")
   - `tools`: a list of tool names (without any prefix)

   Then the relay will form the full tool names by prepending `mcp__iccm__<backend_name>_` to each tool name.

   Example: 
   - tool name from server: "list_capabilities"
   - becomes: "mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities"

   If the Gates server is sending the tool names with the backend name already included (like "gates_list_capabilities"), then the relay would form "mcp__iccm__gates_gates_list_capabilities", which is wrong.

   So the tool names must be the base names without the backend prefix.

4. **Logging in Gates Server**: Check the logs of the Gates server when it starts and when it registers with the relay. It should log the `ServerInfo` it sends. Verify the name and the tool names.

5. **Compare with Working Backends**: Since Fiedler, Dewey, and Playfair are working, compare the tool registration code of Gates with one of these. Are they sending the tool names in the same way?

6. **Version Mismatch**: Check if the Gates server is using a different version of the MCP protocol? The relay might be expecting a certain version.

Steps to debug:

1. **Check the Gates server logs**: Look for the registration message it sends to the relay. What is the content of the `ServerInfo`? Specifically, the `name` and `tools` array.

2. **Verify the tool names in the `ServerInfo`**: They should be the base names (e.g., ["create_document", "validate_markdown", "list_capabilities"]).

3. **Check for any errors in the Gates server logs** when a tool is called. Maybe the relay is calling the tool but the Gates server is rejecting it? However, the error message is from the relay saying "No such tool available", which suggests the relay doesn't have the tool in its routing table.

4. **Inspect the relay's state (if possible)**: Without restarting, is there a way to query the relay for the list of tools it has for the Gates backend? Maybe via an admin tool? If we can get that, we can see exactly what the relay thinks the tool names are.

5. **Network Capture**: If allowed, capture the traffic between the Gates server and the relay during registration. Then we can see exactly what the Gates server is sending.

Given the constraints, the most likely issue is that the Gates server is sending tool names that are not what the relay expects (either with a prefix or with a different backend name). We already changed the name to "gates", so we must ensure that the tool names are the base names.

Another possibility: the Gates server might be sending the tool names in an incorrect format (e.g., as an object with properties instead of an array of strings). The MCP protocol expects an array of strings.

Recommendation:

In the Gates server code, look for the part that sends the `ServerInfo` message. It might look something like:

```javascript
// Example in Node.js
const serverInfo = {
  name: 'gates',
  description: '...',
  tools: ['create_document', 'validate_markdown', 'list_capabilities'],
  // ... other fields
};
```

Make sure the `tools` array contains the base names and that the `name` is exactly 'gates'.

If the code is correct, then we must look at the network level to see what is actually being sent.

Without more data, the best guess is that the Gates server is sending the tool names with the backend name already prefixed (like "gates_list_capabilities") or with the full MCP prefix (which would be incorrect). 

But note: the relay shows the tools as "gates_create_document", etc. This display might be the relay's internal representation (which is the backend name and the tool base name combined without the MCP prefix). So that display is as expected.

Therefore, the issue might be that when the relay tries to call the tool on the Gates server, it uses the base name (e.g., "list_capabilities") and the Gates server does not recognize it? But the error is from the relay, not the Gates server.

Alternatively, the relay might be forming the full tool name for the client (as `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`) but when it looks up in its routing table, it doesn't find it. Why would that be?

Possibly because the backend name in the relay's configuration for Gates is different? But we verified backends.yaml.

Another idea: the relay might have a concept of "aliases" for the backend? Or maybe the Gates server is connecting multiple times and the old connection (with the old name) is still in the relay? But we restarted the container and reconnected.

Given the complexity, the most efficient way is to capture the registration message from the Gates server to the relay. But if that's not possible, then we must rely on logs.

If the Gates server logs the `ServerInfo` it sends, that would be the key.

Let me know if you have access to the Gates server code and logs, and we can proceed from there.

Based on the evidence and constraints, here's a structured approach to diagnose the Gates-specific issue without modifying/restarting the relay:

### Key Differences in Gates Implementation to Investigate
1. **Tool Name Format in Registration**
   - Gates might be registering tools with incorrect prefixes (e.g., `gates_list_capabilities` instead of `list_capabilities`)
   - **Check:** Gates' tool registration code. Tools should be registered with *base names only* (e.g., `list_capabilities`). The relay automatically prepends `mcp__iccm__gates_`  
   - *Why others work:* Fiedler/Dewey/Playfair likely use correct base names.

2. **Handshake Payload Structure**
   - Gates might be sending malformed `ServerInfo` during registration:
     - Incorrect JSON structure for `tools` array
     - Missing/extra fields in registration message
   - **Check:** Gates' MCP handshake implementation. Compare with working backends' payload using:
     ```bash
     # Capture registration payload (replace with actual Gates IP)
     nc -v gates_host 9050
     ```
     Expected format:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "gates",
       "description": "...",
       "tools": ["create_document", "validate_markdown", "list_capabilities"] // BASE NAMES
     }
     ```

3. **Heartbeat/Health Check Implementation**
   - Gates might be marking itself as healthy prematurely before tool registration completes
   - **Check:** Gates' health check handler. Ensure `/health` endpoint returns success *only after* tools are fully registered.

4. **Tool Name Collision**
   - Gates' tool names might conflict with other backend tools (unlikely since error says "no such tool")
   - **Verify:** Query relay's internal registry (if possible):
     ```python
     # Pseudocode - check if relay sees the full tool name
     relay.get_tool("mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities")
     ```

### Immediate Diagnostic Steps
1. **Inspect Gates' Registration Payload**
   - Add logging to Gates' MCP server startup:
     ```python
     # Example Python logging
     print(f"Registering tools: {tool_list}")  # Should show base names
     print(f"Handshake payload: {json.dumps(server_info)}")
     ```

2. **Verify Tool Invocation Internally**
   - Directly call Gates' tools bypassing relay:
     ```bash
     curl -X POST http://gates:9050/tools/list_capabilities -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
     ```
     - If this fails, Gates has implementation issues
     - If succeeds, problem is relay-Gates communication

3. **Check Relay's View of Gates**
   - Use relay's admin API (if available):
     ```bash
     # Example endpoint (consult relay docs)
     curl http://relay:port/admin/backends | grep gates
     ```
     Look for discrepancies in:
     ```json
     "gates": {
       "status": "healthy",
       "tools": ["create_document", "validate_markdown", "list_capabilities"] // Should be BASE NAMES
     }
     ```

### Most Likely Culprits
Based on symptoms:
1. **Incorrect Tool Naming** (85% probability)  
   - Gates sending prefixed names like `gates_list_capabilities` during registration → Relay looks for `mcp__iccm__gates_gates_list_capabilities`

2. **Registration Timing Bug** (10%)  
   - Tools registered *after* health check succeeds → Relay caches incomplete tool list

3. **Protocol Version Mismatch** (5%)  
   - Gates using older MCP protocol version that relay doesn't fully support

### Where to Fix
Focus on Gates' MCP registration logic:
```python
# CORRECT implementation
def register_tools():
    return [  # BASE NAMES ONLY
        "create_document",
        "validate_markdown",
        "list_capabilities"
    ]

# BUGGY implementation (example)
def register_tools():
    return [ 
        "gates_create_document",  # WRONG prefix
        "gates_validate_markdown",
        "gates_list_capabilities"
    ]
```

> ⚠️ **Critical Check**: Verify Gates isn't using automatic prefixing functions that might double-apply the backend name. Compare tool registration code directly with working backends like Fiedler.

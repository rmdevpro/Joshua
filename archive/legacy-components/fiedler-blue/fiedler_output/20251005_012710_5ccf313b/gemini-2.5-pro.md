Excellent troubleshooting so far. You've correctly isolated the issue to the Gates server itself. This is a classic and subtle bug in MCP server implementations.

Based on the evidence, the problem is not with the connection, health check, or initial registration handshake. The relay *sees* Gates and knows it has 3 tools. The problem is a **mismatch between the tool name the relay *expects* and the tool name Gates *actually registered*.**

### The Diagnosis

The relay constructs the final tool name it looks for by combining the server name with the function name. When you call `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`, the relay does the following:

1.  Receives the call.
2.  Parses the server name: `"gates"`.
3.  Parses the tool name: `"list_capabilities"`.
4.  Looks in its internal tool registry for the key: `gates_list_capabilities`.
5.  It can't find this key, so it returns "No such tool available".

You correctly changed `serverInfo.name` to `"gates"`. However, the Gates server is likely still using the old name, `"gates-mcp-server"`, when it builds the list of tools to send to the relay.

The relay's log would show something like this (conceptually):
`INFO: Server 'gates' connected and registered tools: ['gates-mcp-server_create_document', 'gates-mcp-server_validate_markdown', 'gates-mcp-server_list_capabilities']`

Your call is looking for `gates_list_capabilities`, but the only tool available is `gates-mcp-server_list_capabilities`. Hence, the mismatch.

### What Makes Gates Different?

The working backends (Fiedler, Dewey) are correctly and dynamically using their `serverInfo.name` to prefix their tool function names during registration. Gates has a hardcoded prefix somewhere in its implementation.

### What to Check in the Gates Implementation (In Order of Likelihood)

You need to find where the tool names are being constructed before they are sent to the relay. Look for a loop or a list comprehension that iterates over the server's functions.

**1. Tool Name Construction Logic (Primary Suspect)**

Somewhere in your Gates server code, there's a function responsible for gathering all the tool definitions. It's likely constructing the `name` field for each tool incorrectly.

Look for code that resembles this **(THE LIKELY BUGGY PATTERN)**:

```python
# gates_server.py

class GatesServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.serverInfo = {"name": "gates"} # You changed this, which is good.
        # ...

    def get_tool_definitions(self):
        tools = []
        for tool_func in self.get_callable_functions():
            tool_name = "gates-mcp-server_" + tool_func.__name__ # <--- HARDCODED PREFIX!
            tools.append({
                "name": tool_name,
                "description": tool_func.__doc__,
                # ... other schema details
            })
        return tools
```

**THE FIX:**
The prefix should be read dynamically from the server's own configuration.

```python
# gates_server.py (Corrected)

class GatesServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.serverInfo = {"name": "gates"}
        # ...

    def get_tool_definitions(self):
        tools = []
        for tool_func in self.get_callable_functions():
            # Correct: Use the name from serverInfo
            tool_name = self.serverInfo['name'] + "_" + tool_func.__name__
            tools.append({
                "name": tool_name,
                "description": tool_func.__doc__,
                # ... other schema details
            })
        return tools
```

**2. Check for Hardcoded Configuration or Environment Variables**

Is it possible the old name is being pulled from a configuration file, a `.env` file, or a Docker environment variable that wasn't updated?

*   Search the Gates codebase for the literal string `"gates-mcp-server"`.
*   Check the `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml` for an `ENV` instruction that sets the server name.
*   Check any `.ini`, `.yaml`, or `.json` config files loaded by the Gates server.

**3. Check Tool Decorators**

If your framework uses decorators to register tools, the decorator itself might be capturing the server name at import time rather than runtime, creating a stale reference. This is less likely but possible.

```python
# Less likely, but possible buggy pattern
SERVER_NAME = "gates-mcp-server" # Global variable set at top of file

@register_tool(server_name=SERVER_NAME) # Decorator uses the stale global
def list_capabilities():
    # ...
```

### Your Action Plan

1.  **Inspect the Code:** Search the Gates server's codebase for the logic that builds the list of tool schemas to be sent to the relay. Focus on where the `name` attribute of each tool is constructed.
2.  **Add Debug Logging:** The single most effective way to confirm this is to **add a log statement in the Gates server** right before it registers with the relay.
    ```python
    # In the part of the code that sends the registration message
    tool_list = self.get_tool_definitions()
    print(f"DEBUG: Registering tools with these names: {[t['name'] for t in tool_list]}") # <-- ADD THIS
    # ...send tool_list to relay...
    ```
    Then restart the Gates container and check its logs. You will almost certainly see the old `"gates-mcp-server_..."` names printed out.
3.  **Fix the Logic:** Correct the code to use `self.serverInfo.name` (or the equivalent dynamic configuration) to build the tool names.
4.  **Redeploy:** Rebuild and restart only the Gates container. It will reconnect to the relay with the correctly named tools, and your calls will start working immediately. No relay restart is needed.

Hmm, the user is asking a very basic math question: "What is 2+2?" and specifically requests to respond with just the number. 

This seems like a test message, probably to check if I can follow simple instructions. The calculation itself is elementary - any primary school student knows 2+2 equals 4. 

The key here is the strict instruction about the response format. They want only the number, no explanations, no pleasantries. I should respect that precisely. 

The user might be testing:
- Response accuracy (is 4 correct?)
- Instruction compliance (will I add extra text?)
- System behavior (how do I handle trivial queries?)

Since they called it a "test message," they're likely evaluating something. Best to keep it clean and mechanical.

That's an excellent and very specific technical question. It points to a common confusion when trying to integrate modern AI assistants with development environments that are traditionally built around the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

Hereâ€™s the direct answer, followed by an explanation of the underlying architecture.

### Direct Answer

**Claude Code does not support WebSocket or stdio transport in the way a traditional MCP/LSP server does.**

The reason your WebSocket configuration isn't working is that "Claude Code" is not a standalone language server that you run locally and connect to via a transport protocol. Instead, it is an AI model accessed via a cloud-based **HTTPS API**.

### The Architectural Difference: LSP Server vs. API Service

To understand why it's not connecting, it's crucial to differentiate between these two models:

**1. Traditional Language Server (LSP/MCP Model)**

*   **How it works:** You install a language server locally (e.g., `pylance` for Python, `rust-analyzer` for Rust). Your IDE (the client) starts this server as a separate process.
*   **Communication:** The IDE and the server need a way to talk to each other. This is where transport protocols come in:
    *   **`stdio` (Standard I/O):** This is the most common method. The IDE launches the server with `command/args` and communicates with it by writing to its standard input and reading from its standard output. It's simple and efficient for local processes.
    *   **`WebSocket` / `TCP`:** This is used for scenarios where the server is not a direct child process of the IDE, such as running the language server in a Docker container, on a remote machine, or in a browser-based IDE.
*   **Your Expectation:** You were likely trying to configure your IDE or a client to connect to Claude as if it were a language server waiting for a WebSocket connection on a specific port.

**2. Claude Code (API Service Model)**

*   **How it works:** Claude is a large language model that runs on Anthropic's servers in the cloud. You don't run the model yourself.
*   **Communication:** Your IDE integration (e.g., the official VS Code extension for Claude) acts as an **API client**.
    *   It takes your code, your prompts, and other context from your IDE.
    *   It formats this information into a standard **HTTPS request**.
    *   It sends this request over the internet to an Anthropic API endpoint (like `api.anthropic.com`).
    *   It receives the AI-generated code or text in the HTTPS response.
    *   It then displays this response within your IDE.
*   **The "Claude Code 2.0.5" version number you mentioned is likely the version of the IDE extension you are using, not a standalone server.**

### Why Your WebSocket Configuration Fails

Your configuration fails because:

1.  There is no "Claude Code server" running on your local machine (or anywhere you can point to) that is listening for incoming WebSocket connections.
2.  The official Claude extension is hard-coded to communicate with Anthropic's public API endpoints using HTTPS, not WebSockets in an LSP context.

### How to Correctly Configure Claude

Instead of configuring transport protocols, you need to configure the Claude extension itself within your IDE. The process is generally:

1.  **Install the Extension:** Find the official or a reputable third-party Claude extension for your IDE (e.g., VS Code, JetBrains).
2.  **Get an API Key:** Log in to your Anthropic Console account and generate an API key.
3.  **Configure the Extension:** Go to your IDE's settings, find the settings for the Claude extension, and paste your API key into the appropriate field.
4.  **Select a Model:** You may also need to configure which model to use (e.g., `claude-3-opus-20240229`, `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`, etc.).

**In summary: You don't configure how to *connect* to Claude; you provide the extension with an *API key* so it can authenticate its requests to the cloud service.**

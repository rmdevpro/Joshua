We are reviewing the synthesized iccm-network library for deployment.

The library consists of:
- server.py: The main server implementation
- __init__.py: Package initialization and documentation
- pyproject.toml: Build configuration and dependencies

We are to review for:
1. Correctness: JSON-RPC 2.0 and MCP protocol compliance.
2. Completeness: Compared to the original design.
3. Best Practices: Robustness and adherence to asyncio/WebSocket best practices.
4. API Design: Intuitive and easy to use.
5. Migration: Will it work for all ICCM components?

Additionally, we have specific questions.

Let's break down the review:

### 1. Protocol Compliance (JSON-RPC 2.0 and MCP)

The MCP protocol (as per the context) requires:
- `initialize` method: for handshake and capabilities exchange.
- `tools/list` method: to list available tools.
- `tools/call` method: to call a tool.

The server implements:
- `_handle_initialize`: returns server info and capabilities.
- `_handle_tools_list`: returns the list of tools with their schemas.
- `_handle_tools_call`: calls the tool and returns the result.

The responses are wrapped in JSON-RPC 2.0 responses (with "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id", and either "result" or "error").

The error handling uses the MCPToolError and standard JSON-RPC error codes.

This matches the expected protocol.

### 2. Error Handling

The error handling is centralized in `_handle_message`. It catches:
- JSON decode errors (returns parse error)
- MCPToolError (returns with custom code and message)
- Unexpected exceptions (returns internal error with traceback in data)

The error codes used:
- -32700: Parse error (for invalid JSON)
- -32601: Method not found (for unknown method or tool)
- -32603: Internal error (for unexpected exceptions in tool or server)
- -32000: Default server error (for MCPToolError without code)

This is consistent with JSON-RPC 2.0.

However, note that the MCPToolError can be raised by the tool handlers and will be caught and formatted appropriately.

One potential issue: the `_handle_tools_call` method expects the tool handler to return a result that is then put into a `content` array with a type "text". This is specific to the MCP protocol? The example in the `_handle_tools_call` returns:
```python
return {
    "content": [
        {
            "type": "text",
            "text": json.dumps(result, indent=2)
        }
    ]
}
```

But note: the MCP protocol might expect a structured result, not necessarily a string. However, the example in the old Horace implementation used a custom protocol. We must ensure that the MCP relay expects this format.

The original problem statement says the MCP relay will not change. Therefore, we must match what the relay expects. The synthesized code is based on Dewey (the most reliable). So it should be correct.

But note: the `tools/call` method in the MCP protocol might require a different structure. However, without the exact specification, we rely on the Dewey implementation. Since Dewey is working, and this is based on Dewey, it should be acceptable.

### 3. API Simplicity

The API is very simple: the user creates an instance of `MCPServer` with:
- name, version, port
- tool_definitions (a dict of tool names to their schemas)
- tool_handlers (a dict of tool names to async handler functions)

Then they call `await server.start()`.

This is straightforward and requires minimal boilerplate.

### 4. 0.0.0.0 Binding

The server forces binding to `0.0.0.0` (set in `__init__` and used in `start`). This is critical to avoid the "127.0.0.1" binding issue. The code explicitly states it is not configurable. This is correct and by design.

### 5. Migration Path

The example migration for Horace shows a significant reduction in code. The other components (Dewey, Fiedler, Godot) should be able to migrate similarly.

However, note that Fiedler has HTTP proxy integration. The current library does not handle HTTP. It is WebSocket only. The original design did not require HTTP. The problem was with WebSocket connections. Therefore, this library is focused on WebSocket MCP. Fiedler's HTTP proxy would be separate and not handled by this library. So it should be acceptable.

Godot and Horace had network issues, which should be resolved by the forced 0.0.0.0 binding.

Dewey is the reference and should work as is.

### 6. Missing Features

The library is a server only. There is no client implementation. However, the original problem was about server-side connection issues. The MCP relay is the client. So the server is what we need to standardize.

The library does not include:
- Health checks: The MCP protocol does not require it. The relay connects and uses the `initialize` and `tools/list` methods to check the server. So it's not necessary.
- Metrics: Not required by the problem statement. Can be added later as needed.

The library is complete for the stated goal.

### 7. Best Practices

- The server uses `asyncio` and `websockets` appropriately.
- The connection handler is an async method that processes messages until the connection is closed.
- Logging is implemented with a default logger and allows custom loggers.
- The server runs forever until stopped (using `await asyncio.Future()`). This is acceptable for a long-running server.

However, note that the `stop` method is provided for graceful shutdown, which is good.

One potential improvement: the `_handle_message` function sends a response for every message. But note: JSON-RPC 2.0 allows notifications (without id) for which no response is sent. The current implementation will respond to every message, even if it's a notification (with id=None). This is acceptable because the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification says that a response must be sent for every request (with an id), and for notifications (without id) the server must not respond. However, the current code will respond to notifications (with id=None) with a response that includes "id": null. This is allowed? Actually, the specification says that the server MUST NOT reply to a notification. So we must avoid sending a response for notifications.

Let me check the code:

In `_handle_message`:
```python
        msg_id = message.get("id")
        ...
        return json.dumps({
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "result": result,
            "id": msg_id
        })
```

But note: if the message is a notification (no id), then msg_id is None. The JSON-RPC 2.0 specification says that the response must have the same id as the request. However, for notifications, the server must not send a response at all.

Therefore, we must change the code to not send a response for notifications.

This is a critical issue because the MCP relay might send notifications and expect no response. If we send a response for a notification, it would be a protocol violation.

We must fix this.

How to fix:

After handling the method, if the message is a notification (i.e., 'id' is missing or None), then we should not send a response. We can return None and then in the connection handler, only send if the response is not None.

Alternatively, we can change the `_handle_message` to return either a response string or None. Then in the `_connection_handler`:

```python
        async for message in websocket:
            response = await self._handle_message(message)
            if response is not None:
                await websocket.send(response)
```

And in `_handle_message` for notifications, we return None.

But note: what about errors in notifications? The specification says: "A Notification is a Request object without an "id" member. ... The Server MUST NOT reply to a Notification, including those that are within a batch request."

So even if there is an error in a notification, we must not send a response.

Therefore, we must change the error handling as well: if the message is a notification and there is an error, we should log the error but not send a response.

This requires a refactor of `_handle_message` to conditionally build the response only for non-notifications.

Alternatively, we can check at the beginning if it's a notification (id is missing) and then handle accordingly.

Let me restructure:

In `_handle_message`:

```python
        msg_id = message.get("id")
        is_notification = (msg_id is None)  # Note: if the key is missing, get returns None, so this is okay.

        try:
            # ... handle the method and get result
        except Exception as e:
            # ... handle the exception and build an error response
        else:
            # If we are in a notification, we return None
            if is_notification:
                return None
            # Otherwise, build the response
            response = {
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "id": msg_id
            }
            if ...: # if we have a result
                response["result"] = result
            else: # error
                response["error"] = ... 
            return json.dumps(response)

        # But note: we have to handle the case of an exception in the same way: only return a response if not a notification.
        # So we can move the response building after the except block.

        Actually, we can do:

        try:
            ... processing ...
        except Exception as e:
            # For an exception, we have to build an error response, but only if it's not a notification.
            if is_notification:
                # Log and return None
                self.logger.error(...)
                return None
            else:
                ... build error response and return ...
        else:
            if is_notification:
                return None
            else:
                ... build success response ...

        But note: the current code catches MCPToolError and other exceptions and builds a response string. We must avoid building a response for notifications.

        Alternatively, we can do:

        try:
            ... processing ...
        except Exception as e:
            if is_notification:
                # Log and do nothing
                self.logger.error(...)
                return None
            else:
                ... build and return error response ...
        else:
            if is_notification:
                return None
            else:
                ... build and return success response ...

        But note: the current code also catches JSONDecodeError. We must handle that similarly.

        We can restructure:

        if is_notification:
            # We are going to handle the message but not send a response.
            try:
                # We still want to process the method? But the specification says we must not respond, but we can still process it.
                # However, if there is an error, we just log and do nothing.
                ... process the method without returning a response ...
            except Exception as e:
                self.logger.error(...)
            return None

        else:
            ... the current code that builds a response ...

        But that would duplicate the method handling.

        Alternatively, we can factor out the method handling and then conditionally build the response.

        I suggest:

        try:
            # Process the method and get result (or raise exception)
            if method == ...:
                result = ...
            ...
        except Exception as e:
            if is_notification:
                # Log and return None
                self.logger.error(...)
                return None
            else:
                # Build error response
                ...
        else:
            if is_notification:
                return None
            else:
                return json.dumps({ ... })

        But note: the current code already has a try-except for the entire method handling. We can adjust that.

        Let me write the fixed version:

        We'll set a variable `response_obj` to None. Then, if it's not a notification, we build the response.

        Steps:

        1. Parse the message (this can fail, and then we must return an error response only if not a notification).
        2. Check if it's a notification (id is None or missing -> we treat missing as None, so same).
        3. In the try block for method handling, we do the routing and get the result.
        4. If it's a notification, we don't build a response, but we still run the method? Actually, the specification does not forbid processing, but we must not send a response.
        5. If it's a request (with id), we build the response.

        We can do:

        try:
            message = json.loads(message_str)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            # For a parse error, we cannot even know if it's a notification. So we must not respond to a notification? But we don't know.
            # However, the specification says: "When a rpc call is made, the Server MUST reply with a Response, except for in the case of Notifications."
            # But if we can't parse, we don't know the id. So we cannot send a response because we don't know the id and also because it might be a notification.
            # The specification says: "If there was an error in detecting the id in the Request object (e.g. Parse error/Invalid Request), it is impossible to tell the Request was a Notification or not, so the server must not respond to it."
            # Therefore, we must not respond to a parse error at all? But note: the specification says for parse error: "This is the only error that may be returned when the request has not been parsed to a Request object."
            # And the response must have id as null? Actually, the specification says: "The id MUST be Null for a parse error."
            # So we must send a response for parse error even if we don't know the id? And set id to null.

            # The specification: "If there was an error in detecting the id in the Request object (e.g. Parse error/Invalid Request), it is impossible to tell the Request was a Notification or not, so the server must not respond to it." -> This is for an invalid request (like missing jsonrpc, etc.), not for parse error.

            # Actually, the specification says for parse error: "This error is returned when the JSON sent is not a valid JSON-RPC Request object." and the response must have id: null.

            # Therefore, we must respond with an error for parse error regardless of whether it was a notification? But note: the specification says the response for parse error has id: null. And the client can match that? It's a special case.

            # So we do:
            #   return json.dumps({ ... with id: null ... })
            # regardless of whether it was a notification? But the specification says we must not respond to notifications. However, we don't know if it was a notification because we couldn't parse.

            # The specification says: "The Server MUST NOT reply to a Notification, including those that are within a batch request." and "A Notification is a Request object without an 'id' member." -> but if we can't parse, we don't know if it had an id.

            # The specification for parse error: "This is the only error that may be returned when the request has not been parsed to a Request object." and the response must have id: null.

            # Therefore, we must send the parse error response even if we don't know the original id. And the id in the response is null.

            # So we leave the parse error as is: it returns a response with id: null.

            # But note: the specification says that the server must not respond to a notification. However, if the notification was malformed (so we couldn't parse it), then we don't know it was a notification. So we send the parse error response. This is acceptable.

            # Therefore, we don't change the parse error handling.

        So the only change is for the method handling: we must not send a response for notifications (both success and error) and only send for requests (with id).

        We can do:

        In `_handle_message`:

        ... after parsing ...

        msg_id = message.get("id")
        is_notification = (msg_id is None)   # Note: if the key is absent, get returns None -> notification

        try:
            # ... handle the method and get result ...
        except MCPToolError as e:
            if is_notification:
                self.logger.error(f"Notification error: {e}")
                return None
            else:
                # Build error response for e
                return json.dumps({ ... })
        except Exception as e:
            if is_notification:
                self.logger.error(f"Notification error: {e}\n{traceback.format_exc()}")
                return None
            else:
                # Build internal error response
                return json.dumps({ ... })
        else:
            # Success
            if is_notification:
                return None
            else:
                return json.dumps({
                    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                    "result": result,
                    "id": msg_id
                })

        But note: the current code also catches the MCPToolError and then builds an error response. We are now duplicating the error response building in two places (for MCPToolError and for other exceptions). We can avoid that by having a helper.

        Alternatively, we can do:

        try:
            ... processing ...
        except Exception as e:
            error_response = ...   # Build the error response object (without json.dumps) for non-notification
            if is_notification:
                # Log and return None
                self.logger.error(...)
                return None
            else:
                return json.dumps(error_response)
        else:
            if is_notification:
                return None
            else:
                return json.dumps(success_response)

        But note: the current code for the try block does:

            if method == ...:
                ... 
            else:
                raise MCPToolError(...)

        And we have two types of exceptions: MCPToolError and others.

        We can build the error response in the except block without duplication:

        except Exception as e:
            if isinstance(e, MCPToolError):
                error_obj = {
                    "code": e.code,
                    "message": e.message,
                    "data": e.data
                }
            else:
                # Log the unexpected error
                self.logger.error(...)
                error_obj = {
                    "code": -32603,
                    "message": f"Internal server error: {str(e)}",
                    "data": {"traceback": traceback.format_exc()}
                }

            if is_notification:
                # Log and return None
                self.logger.error(f"Error in notification: {error_obj['message']}")
                return None
            else:
                return json.dumps({
                    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                    "error": error_obj,
                    "id": msg_id
                })

        And for the success path, we do:

            if is_notification:
                return None
            else:
                return json.dumps({
                    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                    "result": result,
                    "id": msg_id
                })

        We can refactor the code accordingly.

        This is a critical fix because without it, the server would violate the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification for notifications.

        Therefore, we must change the code.

### Other Best Practices

- The server uses `asyncio.Future()` to run forever. This is acceptable, but note that it will block until the future is cancelled. The `stop` method cancels the server but not the future. Actually, the `stop` method closes the server and then waits for it to close. The `start` method runs the server and then waits on a future that never completes. To stop, we need to cancel that future? Actually, the `stop` method does not break the `asyncio.Future()` wait. We need to cancel the task that is running `start`. This is a common pattern and acceptable because the server is intended to run until the process exits. For testing, we can run the server in a task and then cancel it.

        Alternatively, we can change the `start` method to:

        async def start(self):
            ... 
            # Instead of await asyncio.Future(), we can do:
            await self._server.wait_closed()

        But then the server would stop immediately? Because `serve` returns immediately? Actually, the `websockets.serve` returns a server object, and then we need to keep the server running. The `wait_closed` method is for when we close the server. We want to run until the server is closed.

        We can do:

        async def start(self):
            ...
            async with self._server:
                await self._server.serve_forever()

        But the `websockets` server does not have a `serve_forever` method. The `serve` function returns a `WebSocketServer` which is an asynchronous context manager. We can do:

        async with websockets.serve(...) as server:
            self._server = server
            await asyncio.Future()   # or server.wait_closed()? but wait_closed is for after close

        Actually, the `websockets` documentation says: "The server can be stopped by closing it. This will close the underlying server sockets and stop accepting new connections. Existing connections will remain open until they are closed by the client or the handler returns."

        And to wait until the server is closed, we can do `await server.wait_closed()`. But note: the `start` method currently does:

            self._server = await websockets.serve(...)

        Then we do `await asyncio.Future()`. This runs forever. The `stop` method does:

            self._server.close()
            await self._server.wait_closed()

        This is acceptable.

        However, if we want to make the `start` method cancellable, we can use a future and then cancel it. But the current pattern is common.

        We can leave it as is.

### Additional Suggestions

- The `_handle_tools_call` method returns a result that is always a JSON string in a `content` array. This might be specific to the MCP protocol? But note: the MCP protocol expects a `content` array? The example in the code returns:

        {
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "text",
                    "text": json.dumps(result, indent=2)
                }
            ]
        }

    This is the format that the MCP relay expects? If so, it's fine. But if the tool handler returns a complex structure, we are serializing it to a string and then the client must parse it again? This might be inefficient. However, the MCP protocol might require the `content` array. We are following the Dewey implementation.

    Since the problem states that the MCP relay will not change, we must match the expected format. So it's acceptable.

- The `_handle_initialize` method returns a fixed protocol version. This should be configurable? But the problem says zero configuration. So hard-coded is acceptable.

- The `_handle_tools_list` returns the tools in the format:

        {
            "tools": [
                {
                    "name": ...,
                    "description": ...,
                    "inputSchema": ...
                }
            ]
        }

    This matches the MCP protocol.

### Summary of Critical Issue

The critical issue is the handling of notifications (requests without id). The current implementation sends a response for notifications, which violates the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. This must be fixed.

Therefore, we must require changes.

### Verdict

CHANGES REQUIRED

We must fix the notification handling.

Additionally, I have a few non-critical suggestions for improvement.

### Code Changes for Critical Issue

We will restructure `_handle_message` to handle notifications appropriately.

Here is the fixed `_handle_message` method:

```python
    async def _handle_message(self, message_str: str) -> Optional[str]:
        """
        Handle incoming JSON-RPC message.

        Parses, routes to handler, and formats response (if not a notification).
        Returns None for notifications (to avoid sending a response).
        """
        try:
            message = json.loads(message_str)
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            # Parse error: we must respond with id=null (as per JSON-RPC 2.0)
            return json.dumps({
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "error": {
                    "code": -32700,  # Parse error
                    "message": f"Invalid JSON: {str(e)}"
                },
                "id": None
            })

        method = message.get("method")
        params = message.get("params", {})
        msg_id = message.get("id")
        is_notification = (msg_id is None)  # If id is missing or explicitly None, it's a notification

        try:
            # Route to appropriate handler
            if method == "initialize":
                result = await self._handle_initialize(params)
            elif method == "tools/list":
                result = await self._handle_tools_list()
            elif method == "tools/call":
                result = await self._handle_tools_call(params)
            else:
                raise MCPToolError(
                    f"Method '{method}' not supported",
                    code=-32601  # Method not found
                )

            # For notifications, we don't send a response
            if is_notification:
                return None

            # Success response for non-notification
            return json.dumps({
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "result": result,
                "id": msg_id
            })

        except MCPToolError as e:
            # For notifications, log and return None
            if is_notification:
                self.logger.error(f"Notification error (method={method}): {e.message}")
                return None

            # Error response for non-notification
            return json.dumps({
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "error": {
                    "code": e.code,
                    "message": e.message,
                    "data": e.data
                },
                "id": msg_id
            })

        except Exception as e:
            # Log the unexpected error
            self.logger.error(f"Unexpected error handling {method}: {e}\n{traceback.format_exc()}")

            if is_notification:
                return None

            return json.dumps({
                "jsonrpc": "2.0",
                "error": {
                    "code": -32603,  # Internal error
                    "message": f"Internal server error: {str(e)}",
                    "data": {"traceback": traceback.format_exc()}
                },
                "id": msg_id
            })
```

Then, in `_connection_handler`:

```python
        async for message in websocket:
            response = await self._handle_message(message)
            if response is not None:
                await websocket.send(response)
```

This change ensures that notifications (without id) do not get a response.

### Non-Critical Suggestions

1. **Logging in `_handle_initialize` and `_handle_tools_list`**: Currently, these methods log at info level. This is acceptable, but in a high-traffic server, it might be noisy. Consider changing to debug level? But the problem doesn't specify. We can leave as is.

2. **Type Hints**: The `_handle_message` return type is now `Optional[str]`. We should update the type hint.

3. **Connection Logging**: The connection handler logs at info level for connect and disconnect. This is acceptable.

4. **Error Logging in Notifications**: We added logging for notification errors. This is good because otherwise, errors in notifications would be silent.

5. **Server Start Logging**: The start method logs the tools available. This is helpful.

### Final Verdict

We must fix the notification handling. Therefore, the verdict is:

**CHANGES REQUIRED**

We provide the code changes above for the critical issue.

After applying the fix, the library will be ready for deployment.
</think>
## Review Verdict: **CHANGES REQUIRED**

The implementation is well-structured and addresses most requirements, but contains a critical protocol violation in JSON-RPC 2.0 notification handling. Below are required changes and suggestions:

### Critical Issue (Must Fix)

1. **Notification Handling Violation**  
   JSON-RPC 2.0 requires servers to **NOT** respond to notifications (requests without `id`). The current implementation always sends responses. This will break MCP relay communication.

   **Fix Required**:
   ```python
   # server.py - Update _connection_handler and _handle_message
   async def _connection_handler(self, websocket: WebSocketServerProtocol):
       async for message in websocket:
           response = await self._handle_message(message)
           if response is not None:  # Only send if not notification
               await websocket.send(response)

   async def _handle_message(self, message_str: str) -> Optional[str]:
       # ... existing parsing logic ...
       msg_id = message.get("id")
       is_notification = (msg_id is None)

       try:
           # ... method handling ...
           if is_notification:
               return None  # No response for notifications
           
           # ... build response for non-notifications ...
       except MCPToolError as e:
           if is_notification:
               self.logger.error(f"Notification error: {e.message}")
               return None
           # ... build error response ...
       except Exception as e:
           if is_notification:
               self.logger.error(f"Notification error: {str(e)}")
               return None
           # ... build error response ...
   ```

### Important Suggestions

2. **Result Serialization**  
   Avoid double-JSON-encoding in tool responses. The current implementation forces handlers to return strings, which is inflexible:
   ```python
   # server.py - Update _handle_tools_call
   # Replace:
   "text": json.dumps(result, indent=2)
   
   # With:
   "text": result if isinstance(result, str) else json.dumps(result)
   ```

3. **Protocol Version Hardcoding**  
   Make the MCP protocol version configurable for future compatibility:
   ```python
   def __init__(self, ..., protocol_version: str = "2024-11-05"):
       self.protocol_version = protocol_version

   async def _handle_initialize(self, ...):
       return {
           "protocolVersion": self.protocol_version,
           # ...
       }
   ```

4. **Connection Security**  
   Add origin validation to prevent unauthorized connections:
   ```python
   async def _connection_handler(self, websocket):
       if websocket.origin not in ALLOWED_ORIGINS:
           await websocket.close(code=1008)
           return
       # ... existing logic ...
   ```

### Best Practice Improvements

5. **Graceful Shutdown Enhancement**  
   Add signal handling for production deployments:
   ```python
   async def start(self):
       # ... existing code ...
       loop = asyncio.get_running_loop()
       loop.add_signal_handler(signal.SIGTERM, lambda: asyncio.create_task(self.stop()))
   ```

6. **Input Validation**  
   Add JSON Schema validation for tool inputs:
   ```python
   from jsonschema import validate, ValidationError

   async def _handle_tools_call(self, params):
       # ... existing code ...
       try:
           validate(arguments, self.tool_definitions[tool_name]["inputSchema"])
       except ValidationError as e:
           raise MCPToolError(f"Invalid parameters: {e.message}", code=-32602)
   ```

### Migration Readiness

7. **Compatibility Assessment**  
   The library will work for all ICCM components after fixes:
   - ✅ **Dewey**: Matches existing reliable patterns
   - ✅ **Fiedler**: HTTP proxy can wrap WebSocket server
   - ✅ **Godot/Horace**: Fixes network binding issues
   - ⚠️ **Note**: Horace's non-standard protocol requires adapter layer during migration

### Final Changes Summary

| File | Changes Required |
|------|------------------|
| `server.py` | 1. Notification handling <br> 2. Result serialization <br> 3. Protocol version config <br> 4. Origin validation <br> 5. Input validation |
| `__init__.py` | Update docstring for new parameters |
| `pyproject.toml` | Add `jsonschema` dependency |

**Verdict after changes:** Will be APPROVED. The fixes address critical protocol compliance issues while maintaining the zero-configuration design. Implementation is otherwise robust and follows asyncio best practices.

**Next Steps:**  
1. Implement notification handling fix  
2. Add JSON Schema validation  
3. Update documentation  
4. Test with MCP relay simulator  

Would you like me to provide the complete fixed implementation?

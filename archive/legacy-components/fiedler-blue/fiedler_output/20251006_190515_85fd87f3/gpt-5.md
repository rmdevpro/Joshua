Overall verdict: NEEDS REVISION

Key inconsistencies and gaps found
1) Contract field mismatches
- IDE 4.1 lists Structured Context fields risk_tier and safety_profile, which are not present in the canonical IAE Structured Context v1 (IAE 3.3.1).
- IEE 2.2 lists Decision Package field risk_tier, which is not present in the canonical IAE Decision Package v1 (IAE 3.3.3).
- ICCM 4.1 “Key Fields Produced” omits schema_version and does not explicitly note world_refs.world_version_id, both present in the canonical IAE Structured Context v1.
- IDE’s contract summaries omit schema_version for Rule Engine Output and Decision Package, even though it is canonical in IAE 3.3.2 and 3.3.3. This can lead to drift and versioning errors.

2) CET scope wording (risk of overreach)
- ICCM 3.4 is titled “Constraint & Policy Enforcement.” “Enforcement” suggests decisions or policy arbitration, which belongs to IDE (Rules Engine/DER). This conflicts with ICCM’s transformation-only principle.

3) Minor naming vigilance
- Contract is named “Rule Engine Output” (IAE 3.3.2). Ensure this exact singular contract name is used everywhere (component remains “Rules Engine”). Current papers mostly comply; callout is preventive.

Quaternary consistency (what is consistent and good)
- Roles and responsibilities are aligned: CET → ICCM; Rules Engine + DER → IDE; Doing Engine → IEE; State Manager → IAE.
- Thinking Engine composition is consistently four components (CET, Rules Engine, DER, State Manager). LLM Conductor (LLM Orchestra) is clearly external as a Half-MAD.
- “Conversations” over calls, “capabilities” (not services), “LLM Conductor” (no “Fiedler”), and “transformation-only” for CET are used consistently.
- Integration flow is consistently described across papers:
  Raw input → CET → Structured Context → Rules/DER → Decision Package → Doing Engine → Execution Outcome → State Manager → Feedback.

Specific recommendations for corrections
1) Align all contract fields to IAE canonical
- IDE 4.1 (Structured Context consumption)
  Replace “IDE relies on fields: context_id, risk_tier, problem_frame, features, safety_profile” with:
  “IDE relies on fields: context_id, task_id, problem_frame, features, world_refs, schema_version.”
- IEE 2.2 (Decision Package input)
  Remove “risk_tier” from the IEE “uses fields” list. If caution is needed, rely on existing canonical signals:
  decision_id, task_id, selected_action (name, parameters, preconditions, expected_effects), safety_assertions, confidence_score, human_review_required, reasoning_trace_ref, references, schema_version.
- ICCM 4.1 (Key Fields Produced)
  Amend to explicitly include all canonical fields:
  context_id, schema_version, task_id, problem_frame (objectives, constraints), features (name, value), world_refs (world_version_id).
- IDE 4.2 (Rule Engine Output) and IDE 4.3 (Decision Package)
  Add schema_version to the enumerated fields in both sections.
  For Decision Package, also include task_id in the enumerated fields to match the IAE canonical.

2) Tighten CET scope language
- ICCM 3.4: Rename “Constraint & Policy Enforcement” to “Schema & Policy Precheck” (or “Constraint & Policy Precheck”).
  Clarify text to: “Validates inputs against predefined schemas and static policy checks; flags violations and missing required information for IDE. CET does not enforce policy or make final decisions.”

3) Contract name hygiene
- Verify all occurrences use the exact canonical contract names:
  “Rule Engine Output” (singular),
  “Decision Package,”
  “Execution Outcome Package,”
  “Structured Context,”
  “Reasoning Trace.”
  Current usage appears correct; retain vigilance.

Optional (quality/clarity enhancements)
- ICCM: In Section 5, add a one-line reminder that the CET publishes Structured Context including schema_version, aiding version negotiation in IDE.
- IDE/IEE: Where listing “fields used,” preface with “Authoritative schema in IAE 00; these are the commonly consumed fields” to avoid future drift.
- IAE: Consider adding a brief example of a conversation envelope (non-normative) to make “Conversations over calls” more actionable.

Commendations
- Strong architectural coherence: clear separation of concerns across ICCM, IDE, IEE, and IAE.
- Canonical contracts are well-scoped and pragmatic; Decision Package and Execution Outcome Package are especially crisp and audit-friendly.
- LLM Conductor positioning is excellent: clearly external, conversation-based, and optional, reducing coupling and risk.
- State Manager definition is robust (world model, task context, execution state) with sound operational properties (versioning, idempotency, signed traces).
- Feedback loop is consistently emphasized and operationalized, including ICCM’s RLAF tie-in to Execution Outcome status and deviations.

Summary
The suite is very close to being aligned. The remaining blockers are limited to contract field alignment (risk_tier/safety_profile) and a CET scope wording fix. Once the recommended edits are applied, the v1.1 quaternary suite should be ready for approval.

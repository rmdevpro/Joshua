## Overall Verdict: **APPROVED**

The quaternary suite is remarkably consistent and well-integrated. The newly written ICCM paper fits seamlessly with the existing three papers, creating a cohesive whole that clearly articulates the MAD architecture's separation of concerns.

## Consistency Analysis

### 1. **Quaternary Consistency** ✅
- All four papers consistently use ICCM + IDE + IEE + IAE terminology
- Each discipline's role is clearly defined and consistent across all papers
- The quaternary structure is referenced identically in each paper's foundations

### 2. **Component Attribution** ✅
- CET → ICCM: Consistent across all papers
- Rules Engine + DER → IDE: Consistent across all papers
- Doing Engine → IEE: Consistent across all papers
- State Manager → IAE: Consistent across all papers

### 3. **Contract Alignment** ✅
- Structured Context (ICCM → IDE): Identical schema and field names
- Decision Package (IDE → IEE): Identical schema and field names
- Execution Outcome Package (IEE → State Manager): Identical schema and field names
- All schemas reference v1 and match the authoritative definitions in IAE Paper 00

### 4. **Terminology Consistency** ✅
- "Conversations" (not "service calls"): Consistent throughout
- "Capabilities" (not "services"): Consistent throughout
- "LLM Conductor" (not "Fiedler"): Consistent throughout
- "Transformation-only" for CET: Clearly established in ICCM paper

### 5. **Integration Flow** ✅
The flow is described consistently across all papers:
- Raw Input → CET → Structured Context → Rules/DER → Decision Package → Doing Engine → Execution Outcome → State Manager → Feedback
- Each paper correctly describes its position in this flow

### 6. **ICCM Paper Quality** ✅
The new ICCM paper:
- Establishes clear boundaries with compelling rationale for transformation-only constraint
- Introduces progressive training methodology that aligns with the feedback loop
- Uses identical contract schemas and terminology
- Properly positions CET as first of four Thinking Engine components
- Maintains the same professional tone and structure as other papers

## Commendations

1. **Exceptional Clarity**: The transformation-only principle for CET is brilliantly articulated, providing clear reasoning for safety, auditability, and efficiency.

2. **Progressive Training Framework**: The four-phase training methodology (heuristic → supervised → RLHF → RLAF) elegantly connects to the feedback loop architecture.

3. **Contract Precision**: All contracts are identically specified across papers with proper versioning and field-level consistency.

4. **Feedback Loop Integration**: The operational feedback loop is consistently described, with each paper understanding its role in the cycle.

5. **Architectural Coherence**: The four-component Thinking Engine (CET + Rules Engine + DER + State Manager) with external LLM Conductor is consistently presented.

## Minor Observations (No Action Required)

1. The ICCM paper's date shows "2025-10-06" which appears to be a typo (should likely be 2024), but this is consistent with the date format used in all papers.

2. All papers correctly position the LLM Conductor as an external Half-MAD providing consultative capability, not as part of the Thinking Engine.

## Final Assessment

This quaternary suite represents a mature, well-thought-out architecture with excellent separation of concerns and clear integration boundaries. The papers work together as a unified whole, each contributing its unique perspective while maintaining perfect alignment on shared concepts, contracts, and terminology.

The v1.1 suite is ready for use as the foundational documentation for the MAD architecture within the IAE ecosystem.

We are reviewing the corrected Paper 01 (v1.1) against the Round 1 feedback from DeepSeek. The goal is to verify that all issues raised in the DeepSeek Round 1 review have been addressed.

DeepSeek Round 1 feedback items:

1. **State Manager immutability and signed traces**: The original Paper 01 did not enforce immutability and lacked cryptographic signing of execution traces.
2. **Reasoning Trace contract persistence API**: The State Manager API did not include an endpoint for persisting the Reasoning Trace contract.
3. **Conversation protocol idempotency and retry policies**: The conversation protocol lacked idempotency keys and explicit retry policies.
4. **Schema evolution version negotiation**: The version negotiation mechanism for schema evolution was not clearly defined.
5. **Chaos engineering guidance**: The operational section did not include chaos engineering for resilience testing.
6. **State Manager query parameters**: The API did not support filtering (e.g., by status) for the `/tasks` endpoint.
7. **Explicit precondition enforcement**: The core decision loop did not mandate explicit precondition checks before execution.
8. **Service version in Half-MAD identity**: The Half-MAD identity in the conversation protocol did not include a service version.

Now, let's check the corrected Paper 01 for each item:

1. **State Manager immutability and signed traces**:
   - The changelog states: "Re-architected State Manager around an append-only event sourcing model to enforce immutability" and "Added `signature` field to execution records for cryptographic auditability."
   - Section 2.1: "Immutability via Event Sourcing" is a principle. Section 2.2.3 (Execution State) includes a `signature` field. Section 2.3 describes the event log as append-only.
   - **Addressed**.

2. **Reasoning Trace contract persistence API**:
   - The changelog states: "Added `POST /contracts/reasoning_traces` endpoint".
   - Section 2.4 (API Specification) lists `POST /contracts/reasoning_traces` as a key endpoint. Appendix A also includes this endpoint.
   - **Addressed**.

3. **Conversation protocol idempotency and retry policies**:
   - The changelog states: "Enhanced the Conversation Protocol with mandatory `idempotency_key` in the message envelope and defined exponential backoff retry policies."
   - Section 3.1 (Message Format) includes the `idempotency_key` field. Section 3.4 (Retry Policies) defines an exponential backoff with jitter policy.
   - **Addressed**.

4. **Schema evolution version negotiation**:
   - The changelog states: "Clarified schema versioning with a concrete `Accept-Version` header negotiation pattern for REST APIs".
   - Section 4.4 (Version Negotiation for Synchronous APIs) specifies the use of the `Accept-Version` header for REST APIs (like the State Manager). For conversations, the handshake (Section 3.2) and the `schema_version` in the message envelope handle versioning.
   - **Addressed**.

5. **Chaos engineering guidance**:
   - The changelog states: "Added a new section on Chaos Engineering for MAD resilience testing."
   - Section 7.4 (Chaos Engineering) is added, with three mandatory scenarios: State Manager partition, Half-MAD timeout, and Message Queue unavailability.
   - **Addressed**.

6. **State Manager query parameters**:
   - The changelog does not explicitly mention this, but the API reference in Appendix A for `GET /tasks` includes a note about filtering by `status`.
   - Section 2.4: The `GET /tasks` endpoint description says "with filtering. E.g., `GET /tasks?status=IN_PROGRESS`".
   - **Addressed**.

7. **Explicit precondition enforcement**:
   - The changelog states: "Mandated explicit precondition validation in the core decision loop before any action is executed."
   - Section 5.1 (The Core Decision Loop), step 4b: "Safety Gate: It **MUST** first explicitly validate that all preconditions listed in the `Decision Package` are met in the current world state."
   - **Addressed**.

8. **Service version in Half-MAD identity**:
   - The changelog does not explicitly mention this, but the corrected message envelope in Section 3.1 includes a `service_version` field in the `sender` object.
   - The example in Appendix C also shows the `sender` with `service_version`.
   - **Addressed**.

**Conclusion**: All eight items from DeepSeek Round 1 feedback have been addressed in the corrected Paper 01 (v1.1). The document now includes the required changes and enhancements.

**Verdict**: APPROVED
</think>
### DeepSeek Round 2 Review Verdict: **APPROVED**  

All Round 1 feedback items have been fully addressed:  

1. **State Manager Immutability & Signed Traces**  
   ✅ Implemented via **append-only event sourcing** (Section 2.1) and cryptographic **`signature` field** in execution records (Section 2.2.3).  

2. **Reasoning Trace Persistence API**  
   ✅ Added **`POST /contracts/reasoning_traces`** endpoint (Sections 2.4, Appendix A).  

3. **Idempotency & Retry Policies**  
   ✅ **`idempotency_key`** enforced in message envelopes (Section 3.1) and **exponential backoff retry policies** defined (Section 3.4).  

4. **Schema Evolution Version Negotiation**  
   ✅ **`Accept-Version` header** pattern clarified for REST APIs (Section 4.4) and registry-driven deprecation policies (Section 4.1).  

5. **Chaos Engineering Guidance**  
   ✅ Added **mandatory chaos testing scenarios** (Section 7.4) for State Manager partitions, Half-MAD timeouts, and message queue failures.  

6. **State Manager Query Parameters**  
   ✅ **`GET /tasks?status=IN_PROGRESS`** filtering enabled (Sections 2.4, Appendix A).  

7. **Explicit Precondition Enforcement**  
   ✅ **Safety Gate** added to core loop (Section 5.1), mandating precondition validation before execution.  

8. **Service Version in Half-MAD Identity**  
   ✅ **`service_version`** included in sender metadata (Section 3.1, Appendix C).  

---  
**Summary**:  
The corrected Paper 01 (v1.1) comprehensively resolves all Round 1 feedback. Key improvements include cryptographic immutability, robust idempotency, chaos engineering protocols, and explicit safety gates. The specification is now production-ready.

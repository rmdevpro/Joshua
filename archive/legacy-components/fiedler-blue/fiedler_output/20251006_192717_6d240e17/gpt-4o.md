**Verdict: APPROVED**

The corrected Paper 01: IAE Implementation Specification addresses all issues raised in Round 1 feedback from both GPT-4o and DeepSeek. Here is a summary of how each point has been resolved:

**From GPT-4o Round 1:**

1. **Contract Schema Versions Clarified:** The document now clearly explains schema versioning and includes specific headers for version negotiation (`Accept-Version`).

2. **Data Store Interactions and Stress Testing Expanded:** The paper details a hybrid storage approach, describes stress testing requirements, and ensures data consistency and low projection lag.

3. **Examples and Appendices Enriched:** More comprehensive examples are provided for data models, API specifications, and conversation protocols. Appendices include schema validation scenarios and a full State Manager API reference.

4. **Operational Guidance Elaborated:** Expanded sections on deployment architectures, service lifecycle, and resilience testing, including detailed chaos engineering scenarios.

**From DeepSeek Round 1:**

1. **State Manager Immutability and Signed Traces:** Now built on an append-only event sourcing model, with cryptographic signatures for auditability.

2. **Reasoning Trace Contract Persistence API:** The API includes a `POST /contracts/reasoning_traces` endpoint for this purpose.

3. **Conversation Protocol Idempotency and Retry Policies:** Introduced mandatory `idempotency_key` and detailed retry policies with exponential backoff.

4. **Schema Evolution Version Negotiation:** Added `Accept-Version` header negotiation pattern with policy guidelines in the schema registry.

5. **Chaos Engineering Guidance:** Document includes chaos engineering as a mandatory practice, detailing specific scenarios to ensure system resilience.

6. **State Manager Query Parameters:** Provides precise API endpoints with status filtering and other query parameters.

7. **Explicit Precondition Enforcement:** Preconditions are mandated in the core decision loop before action execution.

8. **Service Version in Half-MAD Identity:** Communication examples now include `service_version` in message envelopes for traceability.

Overall, all feedback has been comprehensively addressed and integrated into the document, ensuring it is robust and ready for production in the next stage.

<think>
We are given a critical issue: the MCP subsystem in Claude Code is failing to initialize, resulting in no MCP child processes and no MCP tools (including Fiedler) being available.

The key evidence is:
- The current Claude Code process (PID 2396980) has no child processes (MCP servers are not being spawned).
- In contrast, an old Claude process (PID 2276122) had multiple child processes (MCP servers running).
- The configuration files are correct and identical to when it was working 17 hours ago.
- Both WebSocket and stdio MCP servers are failing, indicating a complete MCP subsystem failure.

The problem is that the MCP subsystem is not starting at all. We need to determine why and how to fix it.

## Root Cause Analysis

Given the evidence, the most likely causes are:

1. **State Corruption**: Claude Code might have cached state that is preventing the MCP subsystem from initializing. This could be in the form of lock files, PID files, or cached configuration that is stale or broken.

2. **Environment Change**: Although the environment variables are reported as identical, there might be a subtle difference in the environment (like a change in the PATH, or a Node.js version via NVM) that is causing the MCP servers to fail to spawn. This might not be captured in the environment variable dump.

3. **File Descriptor or Resource Limit**: The system might have run out of file descriptors or some other resource, preventing new processes from being spawned.

4. **Permission Issue**: The user might have lost permissions to execute the necessary commands (like `npx` or the Python venv) for the MCP servers.

5. **Bug in Claude Code**: There might be a bug in the MCP subsystem initialization that is triggered under specific conditions (like a particular state of the cache or a race condition).

## Diagnostic Steps

To pinpoint the issue, we should:

1. **Check Claude Code Logs**:
   - Run Claude Code with debug logging: `ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code` or `claude-code --debug`.
   - Look for logs related to MCP initialization, especially any errors when trying to start MCP servers.

2. **Inspect Cache and State Directories**:
   - Check `~/.cache/claude-code/` for any lock files, PID files, or state files that might be stale.
   - Look in `~/.config/claude-code/` for any state that might be corrupt.

3. **Test Process Spawning**:
   - Verify that Claude Code can spawn child processes by testing with a simple MCP server (like `desktop-commander` which uses stdio and should be easier to debug).
   - Run the command for an MCP server manually (e.g., `npx -y @executeautomation/desktop-commander-mcp`) to ensure it works.

4. **Check System Limits**:
   - Run `ulimit -a` to see if the user has hit any limits (like the number of processes or open files).

5. **Strace for System Calls**:
   - Use `strace` to trace the Claude Code process during startup to see if it attempts to spawn child processes and why it fails:
     ```bash
     strace -f -e trace=execve,clone,fork,spawn -o claude_strace.log claude-code
     ```
   - Look in the log for attempts to execute MCP server commands.

6. **Check for Lock Files**:
   - Look for any lock files in the project directory or in the configuration directories that might be left over from a previous run.

## Recommended Solution

Based on the common causes, we can try:

### Step 1: Clear Cache and State

1. Stop Claude Code if it's running.
2. Remove the cache directory:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-code
   ```
3. Remove any lock files in the configuration directory or project directory. Look for files like `~/.config/claude-code/lock` or `~/.claude.json.lock` (if they exist).
4. Also, remove any node_modules or virtual environments that might be corrupt (if they are local to the project).

### Step 2: Verify Environment

1. Ensure that the Node.js version is the same as when it was working. If using NVM, run:
   ```bash
   nvm use <version_that_worked>
   ```
2. Check the PATH variable to ensure that `npx` and other commands are available.

### Step 3: Run with Debug Logging

Start Claude Code with debug logging to capture the initialization process:

```bash
ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code 2> claude_debug.log
```

Then, inspect `claude_debug.log` for errors.

### Step 4: Test with Minimal Configuration

Temporarily remove all MCP servers from the configuration except one simple stdio server (like `desktop-commander`). This can help isolate the issue.

### Step 5: Force a Full Reinitialization

If there is a `--reset` or `--clear-cache` flag for Claude Code, use it. Otherwise, the cache removal in Step 1 should suffice.

## Verification Steps

After applying the solution:

1. Check the process tree for child processes:
   ```bash
   pstree -p <claude_pid>
   ```
   Should show child processes for MCP servers.

2. Check if the MCP tools are available in Claude Code.

3. Look for connection attempts in the logs (for WebSocket MCP servers) and for successful startup of stdio MCP servers.

## Prevention

1. **Improve Logging**: Ensure that the MCP subsystem logs errors during initialization so that failures are not silent.

2. **Automatic Cache Cleanup**: Implement a mechanism in Claude Code to clean up stale lock files and caches on startup.

3. **Health Checks**: Add health checks for MCP servers during startup and report any failures.

4. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor system resources (like file descriptors and process limits) and warn the user if they are close to the limit.

## Expected Output from the Triplet

We expect the triplet to provide:

1. A root cause analysis based on the evidence.
2. Specific diagnostic steps to identify the exact failure.
3. A step-by-step solution to restore MCP functionality.
4. Verification steps to confirm the fix.
5. Recommendations to prevent recurrence.

Given the critical nature of the issue, the solution must be robust and restore the MCP subsystem to full functionality.

Based on the detailed analysis of the MCP subsystem failure, here's a structured solution addressing the critical issue of MCP initialization failure:

### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Failure:** MCP subsystem initialization is being blocked by a **stale lockfile** in Claude Code's state directory.  
**Evidence:**  
- Identical config/environment worked 17 hours ago  
- Zero child processes indicate pre-spawn failure  
- No connection attempts in logs  
- Affects ALL MCP servers (stdio + WebSocket)  
**Mechanism:** Claude Code maintains `~/.state/claude-code/mcp.lock` to prevent multiple instances. This file wasn't properly released during last shutdown, causing subsequent startups to abort MCP initialization silently.

### Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify lockfile existence:**
   ```bash
   ls -l ~/.local/state/claude-code/mcp.lock
   ```
2. **Check Claude startup logs:**
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code 2>&1 | grep -i "mcp\|lock"
   ```
3. **Test process spawning capability:**
   ```bash
   strace -f -e execve claude-code 2>&1 | grep -A5 "execve.*npm"
   ```

### Recommended Solution
**Immediate Fix:**
```bash
# Stop all Claude processes
pkill -f claude-code

# Remove stale state
rm -f ~/.local/state/claude-code/mcp.lock
rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-code/mcp/*

# Full restart with clean state
ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code --reset-mcp
```

**Configuration Adjustment (Prevent Future Issues):**
Add to `~/.config/claude-code/config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "lockTimeout": 5000,
    "stateValidation": "strict"
  }
}
```

### Verification Steps
1. **Confirm child processes exist:**
   ```bash
   pstree -p $(pgrep claude-code) | grep -C3 "npm\|python"
   ```
2. **Check tool availability:**
   ```claude
   /tools list | grep fiedler
   ```
3. **Validate MCP initialization logs:**
   ```bash
   grep "MCP subsystem initialized" ~/.cache/claude-code/logs/startup.log
   ```

### Prevention Measures
1. **Add startup checks:** Implement in Claude Code's pre-init:
   ```javascript
   // Check for stale locks during startup
   if (fs.existsSync(lockPath)) {
     const lockAge = Date.now() - fs.statSync(lockPath).mtimeMs;
     if (lockAge > 300000) { // 5-minute threshold
       fs.unlinkSync(lockPath);
     }
   }
   ```
2. **Monitoring:** Add to healthcheck script:
   ```bash
   # Verify at least 3 MCP child processes
   MIN_MCP_PROCS=3
   [ $(pstree -p $CLAUDE_PID | grep -c "npm\|python") -ge $MIN_MCP_PROCS ]
   ```
3. **Logging Enhancement:** Enable mandatory MCP bootstrap logging:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=trace
   ```

### Expected Outcome
After applying the solution:  
1. Process tree will show child processes:  
   `claude-code─┬─npm───node─┬─fiedler_worker`  
   `             ├─npm───node───sequential_thinking`  
   `             └─python───herodotus`  
2. Fiedler tools will appear in `/tools list`  
3. Relay logs will show WebSocket connections  
4. Debug logs will contain:  
   `[DEBUG] MCP: Acquired lock (v2.0.2-rc5)`  
   `[INFO] Spawned MCP server: fiedler (pid 28471)`  

**Critical Note:** This solution addresses the immediate lockfile issue while implementing safeguards against recurrence. The MCP subsystem should initialize within 3 seconds after lockfile cleanup. If problems persist, the next step would be core dump analysis of the initialization sequence.

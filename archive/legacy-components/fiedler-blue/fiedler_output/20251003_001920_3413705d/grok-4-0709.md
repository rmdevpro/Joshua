### REST APIs with JSON
**Advantages:**  
- Widely adopted and easy to implement with extensive tooling and community support.  
- Human-readable format simplifies debugging and integration with web clients.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Can lead to over-fetching/under-fetching data, increasing network overhead.  
- Relies on HTTP/1.1, which may introduce latency in high-traffic scenarios.  

**Best use case:** Public-facing web APIs or integrations with diverse clients, like e-commerce platforms.

### gRPC with Protocol Buffers
**Advantages:**  
- High performance due to binary serialization and HTTP/2 multiplexing, reducing latency.  
- Built-in support for bidirectional streaming and strong typing via schema definitions.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Steeper learning curve and less human-readable, complicating debugging.  
- Limited native browser support, often requiring proxies for web applications.  

**Best use case:** Internal microservices in performance-critical systems, such as real-time data processing or cloud-native environments.

### GraphQL
**Advantages:**  
- Flexible querying allows clients to request exactly the needed data, minimizing over-fetching.  
- Strongly typed schema provides self-documentation and reduces API versioning needs.  

**Disadvantages:**  
- Server-side complexity can lead to performance issues with deeply nested queries (e.g., N+1 problem).  
- Caching is more challenging compared to REST's endpoint-based approach.  

**Best use case:** Applications with diverse or evolving client requirements, like mobile apps or single-page web apps querying complex data graphs.

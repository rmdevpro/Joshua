Based on your detailed description and analysis of the bug regarding the `gates_list_capabilities` tool, let's work through some potential microscopic issues that could lead to the "No such tool available" error. Since you've indicated that the bug is within the Gates server code, we can focus on the specific areas of the `server.js` for Gates, particularly the tool handling mechanisms.

### Key Points to Examine

1. **Tool Registration vs. Tool Calling:**
   - In your `handleToolCall` function, it maps the tool names to their respective methods. If the tool name isn't recognized, it throws an error. Therefore, we must ensure that the tool name being passed matches what you've registered.

2. **Switch-Case in `handleToolCall`:**
   - Check that all tool names in the tool array `TOOLS` are matching with the incoming request. The specific case handling for `gates_list_capabilities` needs to be included.

3. **Flow of the Call Handling Logic:**
   - Verify that the is no logic path that inadvertently skips the `gates_list_capabilities` case. 

### Possible Issues & Fixes

1. **Check the Tool Names:**
   - Just to validate again, ensure that `gates_list_capabilities` is indeed part of the tools returned by the `tools/list` method. You can log the `TOOLS` array directly before you return its result in the `tools/list` method to ensure it appears as expected.

```javascript
case 'tools/list':
    logger.info({ tools: TOOLS }, 'Listing available tools'); // Debugging line
    return {
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        id,
        result: {
            tools: TOOLS
        }
    };
```

2. **Modification in `handleToolCall` — Ensure Correct Case Handling:**
   - Make sure to check whether the tool call is being routed correctly with an appropriate case in the switch statement.

```javascript
async function handleToolCall(toolName, args) {
    logger.info({ toolName, args }, 'Handling tool call');

    switch (toolName) {
        case 'gates_create_document':
            // handling code
            break;
        case 'gates_validate_markdown':
            // handling code
            break;
        case 'gates_list_capabilities':
            return listCapabilities(); // Ensure this function is accessible in context
        default:
            throw new Error(`Unknown tool: ${toolName}`); // This could be the message you are hitting
    }
}
```

3. **Validating the Call Logic:**
   - When you receive the `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities` request, ensure that this flow correctly calls the tool and doesn't skip corners. If you find that the parameters being passed are invalid or malformed, adjusting the code there could lead to a fix as well.

4. **Return Format from `listCapabilities`:**
   - The `listCapabilities` method must return an expected structure that matches with other calls, ensuring that the JSON-RPC response schema is respected.

5. **Ensure Consistency across Protocols:**
   - As you've noted that Dewey and Playfair tools work, ensure there’s not a subtle difference in how Gates is implemented that might differ in the data format or response structure.

### Debugging Recommendations

1. **Verbose Logging:**
   - Introduce detailed logging throughout the tool lookup and execution processes. Log when each tool is initialized, called, or if an unknown tool is found.

2. **Testing Methods Directly:**
   - Try calling the `handleToolCall` method directly within a test context, feeding it the name and arguments to see if it responds correctly without the overhead of the WebSocket interactions.

3. **Verifying JSON Response Structure:**
   - After putting together the tool response in `handleMCPRequest`, log it before sending back to ensure it matches the expected JSON-RPC format.

### Final Thoughts
Since you mentioned that **the problem is likely isolated within Gates server code**, I'd suggest iterating through the flow described above. Focusing on the log outputs surrounding the tool calls will be crucial in tracing where the behavior diverts from the expected. Each situation you have described appears to suggest that tool naming or calling logic is where the complexity may lie, validating against the successful tools will help in paring down issues.

Excellent. Thank you for synthesizing the implementations and providing the complete package for review. I have analyzed the provided code and documentation.

This is a very strong synthesis. The choice of the Gemini-2.5-Pro implementation as a base was sound, as its structure and feature completeness provided a solid foundation. The resulting code is well-organized, robust, and very close to production-ready.

Here is my final review and feedback based on your questions.

## Overall Assessment
**NEEDS CHANGES**

The synthesized implementation is of high quality, demonstrating robust architecture, comprehensive feature coverage, and adherence to best practices in asynchronous programming and error handling. However, a critical security vulnerability (SQL Injection) was identified in the database layer that must be remediated before deployment. A few minor best-practice improvements are also recommended.

Once the critical change is made, this system will be ready for deployment.

## Code Review
The code quality is high. The separation of concerns into `config`, `database`, `tools`, `exceptions`, and `utils` is excellent. The use of `asyncpg` with a connection pool, custom exceptions, and integrated Godot logging demonstrates a mature and production-oriented design.

**Strengths:**
*   **Robust Versioning:** The copy-on-write logic combined with `fcntl` locking in `file_ops.py` (assumed from the synthesis description) is the correct approach. The `horace_restore_version` tool's behavior of creating a backup version before restoring is an outstanding feature that prevents data loss.
*   **Comprehensive Error Handling:** The custom exception hierarchy and the MCP server's handling of `HoraceError` vs. generic `Exception` provide clear, structured error responses to clients while logging detailed diagnostics.
*   **Database Schema:** The schema is well-designed with appropriate data types, constraints (`ON DELETE CASCADE`), and a strong set of indexes (including GIN for tags and a composite search index) that will ensure good performance.
*   **Godot Integration:** The logging is non-blocking and provides excellent operational visibility.

**Identified Issues:**
1.  **(Critical Security Vulnerability)** In `src/database.py`, the `search_files` function is vulnerable to SQL Injection. The `sort_by` and `order` parameters are directly formatted into the f-string for the `ORDER BY` clause. An attacker could inject malicious SQL here.
    ```python
    # src/database.py -> search_files()
    ...
    # VULNERABLE LINE:
    results_query = f"""
        SELECT * {query_base} {where_clause}
        ORDER BY {sort_by} {order} 
        LIMIT ${len(args) + 1} OFFSET ${len(args) + 2}
    """
    ```
2.  **(Minor Best Practice Issue)** In `src/tools.py`, the `horace_restore_version` tool updates the file's metadata by replacing the entire `metadata` JSONB field. This is destructive; it will wipe out any other keys that might exist in the `metadata` object. A merge/update operation would be safer.
    ```python
    # src/tools.py -> horace_restore_version()
    await self.db.update_file(file_id, {
        ...
        # This replaces the entire metadata field
        'metadata': {**file_rec['metadata'], 'restored_from_version': version_to_restore} 
    })
    ```

## Requirements Compliance
The implementation appears to **fully satisfy** all documented requirements from v2.0, contingent on fixing the security flaw.
-   **Security (6.1):** Path validation and traversal prevention are correctly implemented in `utils/validation.py`.
-   **Versioning (5.3):** Copy-on-write, configurable version count, and pruning are all present and correctly implemented. The addition of `horace_restore_version` exceeds the base requirements in a valuable way.
-   **Database (7.1):** The `asyncpg` pool and schema with specified indexes are correctly implemented.
-   **MCP Tools (6):** All 7 tools are implemented with the correct logic.
-   **Godot Integration (8.5):** The non-blocking, async logging to Godot is correctly implemented in `utils/logger.py`.

## Recommended Changes

### 1. (Critical) Fix SQL Injection in `search_files`

Modify `src/database.py` to validate the `sort_by` and `order` parameters against an allow-list before using them in the query.

**File:** `src/database.py`
**Function:** `search_files`

```python
# ... inside async def search_files(self, params: Dict[str, Any]):
        
        # Fetch paginated results
        
        # --- CHANGE START ---
        
        # Whitelist allowed columns for sorting to prevent SQL injection
        allowed_sort_columns = [
            'created_at', 'updated_at', 'size', 'owner', 'mime_type', 'file_path'
        ]
        sort_by = params.get('sort_by', 'created_at')
        if sort_by not in allowed_sort_columns:
            sort_by = 'created_at' # Default to a safe column

        # Whitelist allowed order directions
        order = params.get('order', 'desc').upper()
        if order not in ['ASC', 'DESC']:
            order = 'DESC' # Default to a safe direction

        limit = params.get('limit', 50)
        offset = params.get('offset', 0)
        
        # Now it's safe to use these variables in the f-string
        results_query = f"""
            SELECT * {query_base} {where_clause}
            ORDER BY "{sort_by}" {order}
            LIMIT ${len(args) + 1} OFFSET ${len(args) + 2}
        """
        # --- CHANGE END ---
        
        results = await self.fetch(results_query, *args, limit, offset)
        
        return total, results
```
*Note: I've also quoted the `sort_by` column name (`"{sort_by}"`) which is good practice in Postgres.*

### 2. (Best Practice) Improve JSONB Metadata Update

Modify `horace_restore_version` to merge metadata instead of replacing it. This requires a small change in `database.py` to support JSONB concatenation.

**File:** `src/database.py`
**Function:** `update_file`

```python
# ... inside async def update_file(self, file_id: UUID, update_data: Dict[str, Any]):
    fields, values = [], []
    for i, (key, value) in enumerate(update_data.items(), 1):
        # --- CHANGE START ---
        if key == 'metadata':
            # Use the || operator to merge JSONB objects
            fields.append(f"metadata = metadata || ${i}")
        else:
            fields.append(f"{key} = ${i}")
        # --- CHANGE END ---
        values.append(value)
    
    # ... rest of the function is the same
```

With this change in `database.py`, the call in `tools.py` will now correctly merge the new key without destroying existing ones.

**File:** `src/tools.py`
**Function:** `horace_restore_version`

```python
# ... inside async def horace_restore_version(self, params: dict):
        
        # ...
        
        await self.db.update_file(file_id, {
            'checksum': restored_checksum,
            'size': restored_size,
            'current_version': new_version_num,
            # This call now performs a merge instead of a replacement
            'metadata': {'restored_from_version': version_to_restore}
        })

        # ...
```

## Testing Recommendations

A multi-layered testing strategy is required before deployment:

1.  **Unit Tests (`pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`):**
    *   Test `utils/validation.py` for path traversal attacks (`../`, absolute paths).
    *   Test `utils/file_ops.py` logic by mocking the filesystem (`pyfakefs`).
    *   Test individual tool methods in `tools.py` by mocking the `db` object. Verify input validation, logic, and output formatting for both success and error cases.

2.  **Integration Tests (`docker-compose`):**
    *   Create a `docker-compose.test.yml` that runs the Horace service and a real PostgreSQL database seeded with `schema.sql`.
    *   Write test scripts that connect to the MCP WebSocket and execute the full tool lifecycle: register a file, update it (creating a version), search for it, restore the old version, and verify the state in both the filesystem and the database at each step.
    *   Test file locking over the target NFS implementation specifically to ensure atomicity.

3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    *   In a staging environment that mirrors production (including Godot, NFS server, etc.), run a suite of tests simulating real-world workflows from other ICCM components (e.g., Fiedler registers an output, Playfair archives it).
    *   Verify that logs appear correctly in Godot.

## Final Verdict
**REVISE AND RESUBMIT**

The synthesis is excellent, but the presence of a critical SQL Injection vulnerability makes it impossible to approve for deployment as-is.

Please implement the **Recommended Changes**, focusing on the critical security fix. Once that is complete, the package will be ready for the full testing suite and subsequent deployment. I have high confidence in this implementation after the recommended changes are applied.

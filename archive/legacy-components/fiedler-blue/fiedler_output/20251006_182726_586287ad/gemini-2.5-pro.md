Of course. This is a perfect use case for intelligent summarization. The original file is a detailed chronological log, which is great for history but impractical for daily use.

Here is the streamlined `REDUCED_CURRENT_STATUS.md` and the `ARCHIVE_NOTES.md` explaining the rationale for the reductions.

# ICCM Development Status
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-06 17:55 EDT

## üéØ Current State & Next Steps

### Current System Status
The ICCM ecosystem is operational, centered around the **MAD (Multipurpose Agentic Duo)** architecture. All core infrastructure services are deployed and integrated.

*   **Core Architecture:** MAD (Thinking Engine + Doing Engine) with shared Half-MAD services.
*   **Communication:** All components communicate via the **MCP Relay** over WebSockets.
*   **Logging:** Centralized, non-blocking logging is handled by **Godot**, which batches logs to **Dewey/PostgreSQL**. Direct Redis connections are forbidden for MCP components.
*   **Data Integrity:** Strict READ/WRITE separation is enforced between **Dewey** (READ) and **Godot** (WRITE).
*   **LLM Access:** **Fiedler** serves as the single gateway for all 10+ LLM models.
*   **Storage:** All persistent data (logs, conversations, files) is stored in PostgreSQL on a 44TB RAID array.

### Next Steps: Building Complete MADs
With the infrastructure stable, focus now shifts to implementing the first two complete MADs.

1.  **Hopper - Autonomous Development & Deployment Agent**
    *   **Purpose:** Develops documents, writes code, and handles automated testing and deployment.
    *   **Status:** Planning phase.

2.  **Grace - System UI (Claude Code Replacement)**
    *   **Purpose:** A modern, web-based UI for interacting with the entire ICCM ecosystem via the MCP Relay.
    *   **Status:** Planning phase.

## üöÄ Most Recent Accomplishments (2025-10-06)

### ‚úÖ WebSocket Frame Limit Increased to 200MB System-Wide
*   **Problem:** Conversation retrieval was failing with "message too big" errors (default 1MB WebSocket limit).
*   **Solution:** The `max_size` limit was increased to 200MB across the entire stack: `iccm-network` library, Godot, Dewey, and the MCP Relay.
*   **Architectural Improvement:** A reusable `MCPClient` class was created in the `iccm-network` library to ensure consistent client configuration.
*   **Status:** **FULLY VERIFIED.** Successfully retrieved a 9.6MB conversation through the full pipeline.

### ‚úÖ MAD Paper 00: Master Document Completed
*   **Milestone:** The "Council of Elders" (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Claude Opus 4) successfully synthesized the master architecture document for the MAD ecosystem.
*   **Process:** Integrated Gemini's structure, Claude's narrative arc, and GPT-5's rigor framework.
*   **Deliverable:** `docs/papers/00_MAD_Ecosystem_Master_Document_v1.0.md` is ready for review.

### ‚úÖ Claude Opus 4 Integration Completed
*   **Problem:** The Claude Opus model was failing due to a missing `anthropic` library and provider implementation.
*   **Solution:** Added the dependency, implemented the `AnthropicProvider`, rebuilt the Fiedler container.
*   **Status:** **FULLY OPERATIONAL.** Claude Opus 4 is now integrated into the Fiedler LLM gateway.

### ‚úÖ MAD Ecosystem Architecture v1.1 Approved
*   **Milestone:** Formalized the MAD architecture, resolving critical gaps in the v1.0 draft related to learning loops, decision-making (LLM Orchestra), and state management.
*   **Status:** Approved by the LLM triplet, greenlighting implementation of Hopper and Grace.

## üèõÔ∏è Critical Architecture Overview

### The MAD (Multipurpose Agentic Duo) Architecture
A Complete MAD consists of a Thinking Engine, a Doing Engine, and shared infrastructure Half-MADs.

**Thinking Engine Components:**
1.  **CET:** Context Engineering Transformer for routing.
2.  **Rules Engine:** For deterministic constraints.
3.  **LLM Orchestra:** Multi-model consultation via Fiedler.
4.  **Decision Maker:** Synthesizes inputs into a final action.
5.  **State Manager:** Maintains World Model, Task Context, and Execution State.

**Infrastructure Half-MADs (Deployed Services):**
*   **Fiedler:** LLM Gateway
*   **Dewey:** READ-only Memory (Conversations, Logs)
*   **Godot:** WRITE-only Logging
*   **Horace:** File Storage & Versioning
*   **Marco:** Browser Automation (Internet Gateway)
*   **Gates:** Document Generation (Markdown ‚Üí ODT)
*   **Playfair:** Diagram Rendering (DOT, Mermaid ‚Üí PNG)

## üèÜ Key Milestones & Decisions Summary

### Architectural Integrity Restored (2025-10-06)
*   **Dewey is READ-Only:** All write tools were removed from Dewey, enforcing the Option 4 architecture where Godot is the single source of truth for writes.
*   **Fiedler Logs All Conversations:** Fiedler was fixed to correctly log all LLM interactions to Godot.
*   **KGB Proxy Eliminated:** The legacy KGB proxy was fully removed from the architecture.

### Critical Decision: MCP-Based Logging is Mandatory (2025-10-05)
*   **Rule:** All MCP servers **MUST** use MCP-based logging by calling the `logger_log` tool on Godot. Direct connections to Godot's internal Redis instance are **FORBIDDEN**.
*   **Reason:** This enforces protocol separation, improves system observability, and prevents architectural violations.

### Core Infrastructure Components Deployed (2025-10-04 & 2025-10-05)
*   **Horace Deployed:** File storage gateway is operational.
*   **Godot Deployed:** Unified logging infrastructure is operational.
*   **Playfair Deployed:** Diagram generation gateway is operational and can save files to disk, resolving previous token limits.
*   **Marco Deployed:** Internet gateway for browser automation is operational.
*   **Gates Deployed:** Document generation gateway is operational.
*   **PostgreSQL Storage Migrated:** Database now resides on a 44TB RAID 5 array, enabling long-term data retention.

### **2. ARCHIVE_NOTES.md**

```markdown
# Archive Notes: Content Removed from CURRENT_STATUS.md
**Date:** 2025-10-06

This document outlines the content that was removed from `CURRENT_STATUS.md` to reduce it to a practical size (<500 lines) and the reasoning for each reduction. The goal is to preserve critical context and recent work while archiving historical implementation details.

### 1. Detailed, Step-by-Step Bug Fixes
*   **Removed Content:** The detailed diagnostic process, file paths, line numbers, and testing steps for numerous resolved bugs (e.g., Playfair BUG #16, Dewey BUG #28, Relay BUG #29, Gates BUG #13, etc.).
*   **Reasoning:** This level of detail is historical. The important outcome‚Äîthat the bug was fixed and what the fix enables‚Äîis preserved in the summary. The specifics belong in version control history (`git log -p`) or an issue tracker, not in a high-level status document.

### 2. Repetitive Deployment Checklists
*   **Removed Content:** The detailed verification checklists for each component deployment (e.g., `‚úÖ Container built`, `‚úÖ Connected via MCP Relay`, `‚úÖ Tools registered`). This appeared for Horace, Dewey, Fiedler, Marco, Playfair, and Gates.
*   **Reasoning:** This information is redundant. The key milestone is that the component is deployed and operational. This is now captured in a single, consolidated "Key Milestones" section.

### 3. Extensive Triplet Consultation Narratives
*   **Removed Content:** The detailed, multi-round narratives of the triplet consultation and consensus process for defining the requirements of Gates, Playfair, and Marco. This included specific model arguments, consultation IDs, and timelines.
*   **Reasoning:** The critical outcome was the creation of robust, unanimously-approved requirements. The process itself is valuable history but not required for understanding the current state. Archiving this declutters the main document significantly.

### 4. Completed One-Time Tasks
*   **Removed Content:**
    *   **Conversation Backup Consolidation:** Details of finding, parsing, and archiving 103 historical conversation files.
    *   **Claude Code UI Integration:** Details about the deployment of the `claudecodeui`.
*   **Reasoning:** These are completed, foundational tasks. Their results are now part of the stable system, but the story of their implementation is no longer "current status."

### 5. Obsolete or Better-Managed Information
*   **Removed Content:**
    *   **Recent Commits:** A list of recent git commits.
    *   **Old "Known Issues":** Sections detailing bugs that have since been fixed.
    *   **Key Files & Locations:** A list of file paths for various components.
    *   **Testing Commands:** Specific shell commands for testing components.
*   **Reasoning:** This information is better suited for other tools. `git log` tracks commits, an issue tracker manages bugs, and the codebase itself is the source of truth for file locations and test scripts. Including them in a status doc leads to staleness and clutter.

### 6. Overly Detailed Accomplishments from Older Sessions (Pre 2025-10-06)
*   **Removed Content:** The highly detailed descriptions of work from 2025-10-04 and 2025-10-05 were summarized into single-line milestone entries. For example, the entire multi-section narrative of deploying Gates and Playfair was condensed to "Gates Deployed" and "Playfair Deployed" with a brief note on their function.
*   **Reasoning:** Per the request, the most recent 1-2 sessions are kept detailed, while older work is summarized as important milestones. This maintains focus on what's new and relevant for the current work period.

By removing this historical and overly granular content, the `CURRENT_STATUS.md` file is transformed from a chronological log into a strategic overview, making it far more effective for daily use.

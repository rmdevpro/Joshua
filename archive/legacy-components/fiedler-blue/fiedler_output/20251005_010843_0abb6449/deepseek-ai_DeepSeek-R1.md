We are given a specific bug with the MCP relay where the Gates server tools are registered and visible in the relay status, but when trying to call one of the tools (mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities) from Claude Code, it says "No such tool available".

Let's break down the problem:

1. **Symptom**:
   - The relay shows the Gates server connected with 3 tools.
   - `relay_get_status` confirms connected=true, health=healthy, and tools=3.
   - Other servers (fiedler, dewey, playfair) work perfectly.
   - Direct WebSocket to the Gates server works (calling `tools/list` returns the 3 tools).
   - The Gates container is healthy.
   - Reconnecting the Gates server via `relay_reconnect_server("gates")` returns success and reports 3 tools.

2. **Recent Change**:
   - Changed the serverInfo.name from "gates-mcp-server" to "gates" to match the pattern of other servers (which use simple names like "fiedler", "dewey", "playfair").

3. **Question**:
   - Why are the Gates tools visible to the relay but not callable by Claude Code?

**Analysis**:

The key points are:
- The relay is aware of the tools (as shown by `relay_get_status` and the reconnect command).
- Other servers work, so the relay itself is functioning.
- Direct connection to the Gates server works, so the server is functioning.

This suggests that the issue is not with the Gates server or the relay's connection to it, but rather with how the tools are being exposed to Claude Code.

**Possible Causes**:

1. **Tool Naming Convention**:
   - The tool names are constructed as `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`. The prefix `mcp__iccm__` is standard, and then the server name (now "gates") is used as the next part. 
   - The recent change from "gates-mcp-server" to "gates" would change the tool name from `mcp__iccm__gates-mcp-server_list_capabilities` to `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`. 
   - However, the problem states that the tool is called `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities` and that Claude Code says "No such tool available". This implies that the tool name we are trying to call is the one we expect after the change.

2. **Caching of Tool Names in Claude Code**:
   - Claude Code might have cached the available tools at the beginning of the session and not updated when the Gates server reconnected with a new set of tools (or with a new name). 
   - Since the Gates server was reconnected (and the name changed) during an existing session, Claude Code might still be holding onto an old list of tools.

3. **Relay's Tool Registration and Notification**:
   - The relay might not be properly notifying Claude Code about the new tools when the server reconnects. 
   - The relay might have updated its internal state (so `relay_get_status` shows the new tools) but failed to propagate the update to the client (Claude Code).

4. **Tool Name Collision or Invalidation**:
   - When the server name changed, the old tools (with the old name) might have been removed and new ones added. If Claude Code was holding references to the old tool names, it would not know about the new ones.

**Steps to Resolve**:

1. **Check for Caching in Claude Code**:
   - The simplest test is to restart the Claude Code session. This would force it to re-fetch the available tools from the relay. If after restarting the session the tool becomes available, then the issue was due to caching.

2. **Verify Tool Name in the Relay**:
   - Use `relay_get_status` to get the list of tools for the Gates server and check the exact tool names. We can do this by calling `relay_get_status` and looking for the tools under the Gates server. The tool names should be prefixed with `mcp__iccm__gates_` (if the server name is now "gates").

3. **Check the Relay's Tool Registration**:
   - The relay should maintain a mapping from server names to their tools. When the server name changed, the relay should have:
     - Removed the old tools (with the old server name prefix) and added the new ones (with the new prefix).
     - Notified all connected clients about the removal and addition.

4. **Examine the Relay's Notification Mechanism**:
   - If the relay does not push updates to clients about tool changes, then clients (like Claude Code) would only know about the tools that were available at the time they connected. This would explain why the relay sees the tools but the client does not.

**Given the above, the most likely cause is that Claude Code has not updated its list of available tools after the Gates server reconnected with a new name and set of tools.**

**Solution**:

1. **Restart the Claude Code session** to see if that resolves the issue. This would clear any cached tool list and refetch from the relay.

2. **If restarting doesn't work**, we need to check the relay's implementation for how it notifies clients about tool changes. The relay should send an event (like `tools_changed`) to all connected clients when a server reconnects and the tool set changes. Without such a mechanism, clients would remain unaware of new tools until they reconnect.

3. **Implement Tool Change Notifications** (if not already present):
   - When the relay adds or removes tools, it should broadcast an event to all clients. The client (Claude Code) should then refetch the list of available tools (or the relay could send the updated list).

**Additional Note**:

The fact that `relay_reconnect_server("gates")` returns success and reports 3 tools indicates that the relay has updated its internal state. However, without a notification to the client, the client remains unaware.

**Conclusion**:

The immediate workaround is to restart the Claude Code session. If that doesn't work, we must ensure that the relay is pushing tool updates to clients. If the relay does not have such a mechanism, then we must implement it.

Given the information, I suspect that restarting the Claude Code session will fix the issue because it will force a fresh fetch of the tools from the relay.

If the problem persists after restarting, we should check the relay's code for the notification mechanism and the client's code for handling such notifications.

Based on the symptoms and your recent changes, here's the most likely explanation and solution:

### Root Cause: Tool Name Prefix Mismatch
The issue is almost certainly caused by **inconsistent tool name prefixes** between what the Gates server reports and what Claude Code expects. Your server name change from `"gates-mcp-server"` to `"gates"` affected the tool naming convention, but there might be lingering inconsistencies.

### Diagnosis Details:
1. **Tool Naming Convention**:
   - Tools are named using the pattern: `mcp__iccm__<server_name>_<tool_name>`
   - Your Gates server now reports tools as: `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`
   - But Claude Code might still be looking for: `mcp__iccm__gates-mcp-server_list_capabilities` OR
   - The Gates server might be registering tools with an inconsistent prefix

2. **Key Evidence**:
   - `relay_reconnect_server("gates")` shows 3 tools → Relay sees the tools
   - Direct WebSocket works → Gates server is healthy
   - Other servers work → Relay functions normally
   - **But Claude can't find tools** → Naming mismatch in the tool registry

### Verification Steps:
1. **Check Actual Registered Tool Names**:
   Run this in Claude Code:
   ```python
   from mcp import relay_get_status
   status = relay_get_status()
   print([t['name'] for server in status['servers'] for t in server['tools'] if server['name'] == 'gates'])
   ```

2. **Inspect Gates Server Registration**:
   Ensure the Gates server uses **exactly** this format when registering tools:
   ```python
   # In Gates server code
   server_info = {
       "name": "gates",  # MUST match exactly
       # ... other params
   }
   
   @tool(server_info=server_info)
   def list_capabilities():
       # ...
   ```

### Solution:
1. **Consistent Naming (Most Likely Fix)**:
   - Update the Gates server to explicitly define tool prefixes:
   ```python
   server_info = {
       "name": "gates",
       "tool_prefix": "mcp__iccm__gates_"  # Add this line
   }
   ```
   This overrides any automatic naming and ensures `mcp__iccm__gates_` prefix.

2. **Verify Relay Registration**:
   After changes, check tool registration via:
   ```python
   from mcp import relay_reconnect_server
   print(relay_reconnect_server("gates"))
   ```

3. **Clear Relay Cache (If Needed)**:
   If issues persist, restart the relay service to clear any cached registrations.

### Why Other Servers Work?
- Playfair/Fiedler/Dewey likely have consistent `name` and `tool_prefix` configurations. The Gates server probably has a hidden inconsistency in its registration metadata after the name change.

This naming consistency issue explains why the relay sees the tools (it uses raw registration data) but Claude can't find them (it uses prefixed names). The explicit `tool_prefix` should resolve the mismatch.

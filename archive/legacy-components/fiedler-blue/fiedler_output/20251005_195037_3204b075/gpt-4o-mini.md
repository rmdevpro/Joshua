APPROVE FOR DEPLOYMENT

**Confirmation of Critical Issues Resolved:**
1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability**: The fixes applied for SQL injection by implementing whitelisting for `sort_by` columns and ordering direction (ASC/DESC) are correct. Additionally, quoting column names in the ORDER BY clause helps to ensure safety against injection. The use of prepared statements continues to enhance security.
   
2. **Metadata JSONB Merge**: The modification using the PostgreSQL `||` operator in the `update_file` method for merging metadata is appropriate. This ensures that existing metadata is updated correctly without being overwritten destructively.

3. **Field Validation**: The implementation of the `ALLOWED_FIELDS` whitelist to validate field names in `update_file` is well executed. It effectively prevents arbitrary SQL construction and enhances the integrity of the updates.

**Remaining Concerns:**
- The current implementation looks thorough with respect to the mentioned critical issues. However, it's advisable to conduct broader testing on SQL Injection scenarios to ensure all possible entry points are secure, especially on any additional parts of the code that may directly interact with SQL.
- Consider implementing additional logging for failed update attempts due to invalid fields, which may be useful for monitoring and debugging.
- Future enhancements could include unit tests for these methods to automatically validate that the protections against SQL injection and other issues remain intact over subsequent code changes.

Overall, the critical fixes have been effectively applied, and the code appears ready for deployment.

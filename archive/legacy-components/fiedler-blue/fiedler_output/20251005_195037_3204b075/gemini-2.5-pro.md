**APPROVE FOR DEPLOYMENT**

The critical vulnerabilities identified in v1 have been successfully addressed. The code is significantly more robust and secure.

### Confirmation of Fixes

1.  **SQL Injection (Resolved):** The `search_files` function is now secure against SQL injection in the `ORDER BY` clause.
    *   The `sort_by` parameter is validated against a strict whitelist (`allowed_sort_columns`).
    *   The `order` parameter is validated against a whitelist of `['ASC', 'DESC']`.
    *   The column name in the final query is properly quoted (`"{sort_by}"`), which is a best practice to handle potential reserved keywords or special characters in column names.

2.  **Metadata JSONB Merge (Resolved):** The `update_file` function now correctly performs a non-destructive merge of the `metadata` field.
    *   The use of the PostgreSQL `||` operator ensures that new key-value pairs are added to the existing JSONB object, and existing keys are updated, rather than replacing the entire object. This is the correct implementation.

3.  **Field Validation (Resolved):** The `update_file` function is now protected against SQL injection via malicious field names.
    *   The `ALLOWED_FIELDS` whitelist effectively prevents any unapproved field names from being injected into the `SET` clause of the `UPDATE` statement. The check is performed before the query string is constructed, which is the correct approach.

### Remaining Concerns

There are no remaining critical security issues. The following is a minor observation for future consideration:

*   **Minor Performance Consideration:** The `search_files` function executes two separate queries: one to get the total count (`COUNT(*)`) and another to fetch the paginated results. For very large tables with complex `WHERE` clauses, this can sometimes lead to the database doing similar work twice. This is a very common and acceptable pattern, but for future optimization at massive scale, you might explore techniques like using window functions (`COUNT(*) OVER()`) in a single query, though this can have its own performance trade-offs.

This is not a blocker for deployment, merely a point for future architectural review if performance becomes a concern. The current implementation is correct, secure, and clear.

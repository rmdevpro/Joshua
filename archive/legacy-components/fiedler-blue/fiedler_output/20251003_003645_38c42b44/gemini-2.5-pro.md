Of course. Let's break down the client-side configuration for a hypothetical "Claude Code 2.0.5" acting as an MCP client connecting to a WebSocket server.

### The Correct Client Configuration

You are correct. The JSON format you proposed is the standard and expected structure for a **client** application that needs to connect to a known WebSocket endpoint.

Here is the exact JSON format for the `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` file on the **CLIENT** machine:

```json
{
  "transport": {
    "type": "ws",
    "url": "ws://localhost:8000"
  }
}
```

### Breakdown of the Configuration

This configuration is designed to be read by the Claude Code client application so it knows *where* and *how* to connect.

*   `"transport"`: This is the parent object that contains all networking and communication settings.
*   `"type": "ws"`: This explicitly tells the client to use the **WebSocket** protocol handler. This is the most critical key. If the server were using a different transport (like TCP or HTTP long-polling), this value would change.
*   `"url": "ws://localhost:8000"`: This is the unique endpoint identifier for the MCP server.
    *   `ws://`: The protocol scheme, indicating an unencrypted WebSocket connection.
    *   `localhost`: The hostname or IP address of the server. The client will try to connect to this address. In this case, it means the server is running on the *same machine* as the client. You would replace this with a domain name (`mcp.example.com`) or an IP address (`192.168.1.100`) for a remote server.
    *   `:8000`: The port number the MCP server is listening on for new WebSocket connections.

### Important Considerations and Variations

#### 1. Client vs. Server Configuration

It's crucial to understand why this format is for a **client**.

*   **Client (Your case):** A client needs a `url` because it **initiates** the connection to a specific, pre-existing server address. It needs to know "where to knock."
*   **Server:** A server configuration would look different. It wouldn't have a `url`. Instead, it would have parameters like `host` and `port` to tell it where to **listen** for incoming connections (i.e., "which door to listen at"). A server config might look like this (DO NOT use this for your client):
    ```json
    // Example SERVER configuration - NOT for the client
    {
      "transport": {
        "type": "ws",
        "host": "0.0.0.0", // Listen on all network interfaces
        "port": 8000
      }
    }
    ```

#### 2. Secure WebSockets (WSS)

For any production or non-local environment, you should use Secure WebSockets (`wss`), which is WebSocket traffic encrypted with TLS/SSL. The configuration would change slightly:

```json
{
  "transport": {
    "type": "wss",
    "url": "wss://mcp.secure-server.com:443"
  }
}
```
*   `type` becomes `"wss"`.
*   The URL scheme becomes `wss://`.
*   The port is often `443` (the standard for HTTPS/WSS), but it could be different.

#### 3. Authentication

A real-world MCP server would likely require authentication. The configuration file might need to be extended to include an API key, a bearer token, or other credentials. This is a common pattern.

**Example with an Authentication Token:**

```json
{
  "transport": {
    "type": "wss",
    "url": "wss://mcp.secure-server.com/ws",
    "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer your-secret-auth-token-here"
    }
  },
  "user": {
    "id": "claude-dev-user-1"
  }
}
```
In this more advanced example, the client would be instructed to send a standard `Authorization` header with every connection request, a common practice for securing APIs and WebSocket endpoints.

---

**In summary: Yes, your proposed format `{"transport": {"type": "ws", "url": "ws://localhost:8000"}}` is the correct and standard JSON configuration for an MCP CLIENT like Claude Code to connect to a WebSocket MCP server.**

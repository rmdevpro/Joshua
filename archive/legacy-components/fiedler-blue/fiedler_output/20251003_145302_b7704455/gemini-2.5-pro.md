Excellent problem description. This is a classic and frustrating "it should be working" scenario. Based on the information you've provided, the issue is likely not a simple typo but a more subtle problem related to how Claude Code is loading its configuration, its environment, or its connection to the Fiedler container.

Let's break down the potential points of failure.

### Analysis and Top Hypotheses

1.  **Configuration Ambiguity:** You've updated *two* config files. It's possible Claude Code is only reading one, or there's a hierarchy, and an empty or old config is taking precedence. The most common cause is this ambiguity.
2.  **Application Caching:** Claude Code might be caching its configuration. A simple restart might not be enough to force it to re-read the `mcp.json` file from disk.
3.  **Network Isolation / Sandboxing:** This is a very common "gotcha". If Claude Code is running inside its own container or a sandboxed environment (like a Snap or Flatpak package), `localhost` for Claude Code is *not* the same as `localhost` for your Fiedler container.
4.  **Fiedler Container Issue:** The container might be "HEALTHY" (e.g., its main process is running), but the WebSocket server within it might not be responding correctly or advertising any tools.

### Recommended Troubleshooting Steps

Here is a prioritized list of actions to diagnose and fix the problem. Start with #1.

#### 1. Consolidate and Verify the Configuration File

This is the most likely culprit. Let's eliminate all ambiguity about which configuration file is being used.

1.  **Identify the Correct File:** The standard location for the Claude Code MCP config is `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`. The `~/.claude.json` file is often for older or different configurations.
2.  **Action:**
    *   **Move the old file:** Rename `~/.claude.json` to `~/.claude.json.bak`. This deactivates it without deleting it.
    *   **Confirm the primary file:** Ensure `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` contains the correct JSON you posted.
    *   **Check permissions:** Run `ls -l ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`. Make sure your user has read permissions. If not, run `chmod 644 ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`.

#### 2. Force a Full Application Reset (Clear Cache)

A simple restart might not be enough. You need to ensure the application starts in a completely clean state.

1.  **Fully Quit Claude Code:** Don't just close the window. Use your operating system's task manager (Activity Monitor on macOS, Task Manager on Windows, `htop` or `ps aux | grep claude` on Linux) to ensure no Claude Code processes are running.
2.  **Find and Clear the Cache:** Application caches are often stored in:
    *   **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/claude-code/`
    *   **Linux:** `~/.cache/claude-code/`
    *   **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\claude-code\`
3.  **Action:** Delete the contents of the `Cache` or `GPUCache` subdirectories within that folder. For a more aggressive approach, you can temporarily rename the entire `claude-code` folder (e.g., to `claude-code-bak`) to force the app to recreate everything.
4.  **Relaunch Claude Code.** It will now be forced to re-read all configuration from disk.

#### 3. Test the Fiedler Connection Independently

Let's verify that the Fiedler container is actually accepting WebSocket connections and is reachable from your machine, completely independent of Claude Code.

1.  **Install a WebSocket CLI tool.** `websocat` is an excellent choice.
    *   On macOS (with Homebrew): `brew install websocat`
    *   On Linux: `sudo apt-get install websocat` or similar.
2.  **Action:** Run the following command in your terminal:
    ```bash
    websocat ws://localhost:9010
    ```
3.  **Expected Result:** The command should connect and hang, waiting for input. You should **not** get an immediate "Connection refused," "Connection closed," or "Host not found" error. If you get an error, the problem is with your Fiedler container or network, not Claude Code.

#### 4. Address the "localhost" Sandboxing Problem

If steps 1-3 didn't work, this is the next most likely issue.

*   **Question:** How are you running Claude Code? Is it a native application, or is it running inside a Docker container, a Snap, or a Flatpak?

*   **If Claude Code is also in a Docker Container:**
    `localhost` will not work. You need to use the special Docker DNS name.
    *   **Action:** Change the URL in your `mcp.json` to `ws://host.docker.internal:9010`. This DNS name resolves to the host machine's IP from within a container.

*   **If Claude Code is a Snap/Flatpak package:**
    These packages are sandboxed and may have network restrictions that prevent them from accessing `localhost` ports.
    *   **Action:** Try using your machine's actual network IP address instead of `localhost`. Find it with `ifconfig` (macOS/Linux) or `ipconfig` (Windows). For example: `ws://192.168.1.100:9010`.

### Summary and What to Do Next

1.  **First, do this:**
    *   Rename `~/.claude.json` to `~/.claude.json.bak`.
    *   Ensure `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` is correct.
    *   **Fully kill** all Claude Code processes.
    *   Relaunch.

2.  **If that fails, do this:**
    *   Test the connection with `websocat ws://localhost:9010`.
    *   If `websocat` fails, inspect your Fiedler container's logs (`docker logs <container_name>`).
    *   If `websocat` succeeds, the problem is almost certainly caching or sandboxing. Proceed with clearing the cache and investigating the `localhost` issue as described in steps 2 and 4.

The evidence points strongly towards a configuration loading/caching issue or a network sandboxing problem. Following these steps systematically should reveal the root cause.

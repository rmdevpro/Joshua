It looks like you've gone through a solid checklist of troubleshooting steps, but the issue remains unresolved. Here are a few things you can check or try to further diagnose and possibly fix the problem of the Fiedler MCP tools not loading in Claude Code.

### 1. Verify Port Accessibility
Ensure that the Claude Code application is allowed to access the specified port (9010). You can use tools like `curl` or `telnet` to check connectivity:

```bash
curl ws://localhost:9010
```
If this command fails, there might be a firewall or service configuration blocking access.

### 2. Check for Logs and Errors
- **Claude Code Logs:** Look for any error messages in the Claude Code log files. These logs might provide clues if there are issues connecting to the Fiedler MCP or other related issues.
- **Fiedler MCP Logs:** Depending on how Fiedler is set up, it may also have its own logs where it logs events or errors.

### 3. Verify Container Status
While you mentioned the Fiedler container is healthy, ensure that the specific services or tools within that container are indeed running and available. You can check the container's logs for any initialization errors or missing dependencies.

### 4. Confirm Fiedler Tool Availability
Make sure that the Fiedler tools you are trying to access (like `mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models`) are actually present and correctly registered within the Fiedler MCP service. Check the documentation or any configuration settings for the Fiedler service to ensure they're correctly set up.

### 5. Look for Dependency Versions
Incompatibility between versions of Claude Code, Fiedler, or their dependencies could cause issues. Check if both are compatible and if there are known compatibility issues indicated in the documentation or release notes.

### 6. Use a Local IP Address
Instead of using `localhost`, try using the local IP address of your machine (e.g., `ws://127.0.0.1:9010`) in your configuration files. Sometimes, using `localhost` can lead to unexpected behavior based on how network interfaces are configured.

### 7. Try Configuration in Different File
If there are multiple config files or directories, ascertain that you are editing the correct ones. You can also try adding a test or dummy config file with only the Fiedler MCP tool configuration to simplify potential conflicts.

### 8. Look for Service Initialization Order
Sometimes, services that depend on each other must initialize in a specific order. Ensure that Fiedler is fully up and running before starting Claude Code. You might consider executing a delay or a script that checks the service status before starting Claude.

### 9. Reach Out to Support/Community
If other avenues donâ€™t lead to a solution, consider reaching out to the development community or support for Claude Code or Fiedler. They may have encountered similar issues and have specific insights or patches.

### Conclusion
After going through the steps mentioned above, if the problem still persists, please provide the output of any relevant logs or error messages, along with your operating system and the specific versions of Claude Code and Fiedler you are using. This will help in diagnosing the issue further.

## Triplet Consultation: Fiedler MCP Bug - Attempt #9

This is an excellent and detailed bug report. Your analysis is correct. The previous attempts failed because they were trying to use a network transport (`ws`) to bridge a connection that the architecture explicitly defines as a direct process execution (`docker exec`).

This is a classic case of a configuration mismatch where the transport protocol doesn't align with the execution environment. The silent failure is the key clue: Claude Code isn't even *trying* to connect via WebSocket because its configuration for the bare metal environment expects a different connection type for direct container interaction.

The "blue solid line" in your diagram is the answer. It represents piping standard input/output (stdio) directly to the process started by `docker exec`.

### The Solution

The correct approach is to configure Fiedler exactly like the other working `stdio` servers, such as `desktop-commander`. You will use the `stdio` transport type and invoke the Fiedler process inside its container via `docker exec`.

Here is the specific configuration to place in your project's `~/.claude.json` file.

**Action:**
1.  Ensure any old `fiedler` configurations are removed from BOTH `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` and `~/.claude.json`.
2.  Add the following block inside the `mcpServers` object in `~/.claude.json`.

### **Required Configuration for `~/.claude.json`**

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "/home/aristotle9": {
      "mcpServers": {
        "fiedler": {
          "transport": {
            "type": "stdio"
          },
          "command": "docker",
          "args": [
            "exec",
            "-i",
            "fiedler-mcp",
            "fiedler"
          ]
        }
        // ... other project-specific MCP servers can go here
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Why This Configuration Will Work (Where Attempts #1-8 Failed)

1.  **Matches the Architecture:** This configuration directly implements the "blue solid line" from your diagram.
    *   `"command": "docker"` tells Claude Code to execute the `docker` binary.
    *   `"args": ["exec", "-i", "fiedler-mcp", "fiedler"]` are the exact arguments needed to start the `fiedler` process inside the `fiedler-mcp` container and attach to its standard I/O. The `-i` flag is crucial as it keeps `STDIN` open, allowing Claude Code to pipe commands to it.

2.  **Correct Transport Protocol (`stdio`):** This is the root cause of the previous failures.
    *   By specifying `"type": "stdio"`, you are telling Claude Code to communicate by writing to the process's standard input and reading from its standard output. This is the mechanism used for shell command-based tools.
    *   The WebSocket attempts (`"type": "ws"`) failed because they instructed Claude Code to open a network socket to a URL (`ws://...`). Claude Code, in its bare metal configuration, does not bridge a `docker exec` command to a WebSocket. It treats them as two mutually exclusive transport types. The Fiedler container's WebSocket server (on port 9010) is meant for *networked clients* (like a containerized Claude), not for a direct `exec` call from the host.

3.  **Bypasses Network Issues:** Since this method doesn't use network sockets (localhost, IPs, etc.), it completely sidesteps all the potential issues you were debugging with `wscat` and different URLs. The connection is managed directly by the Docker daemon, which is proven to be working by the `desktop-commander` example.

4.  **Consistency with Working MCPs:** The proposed configuration uses the *exact same pattern* as your working `desktop-commander` server. This is the strongest indicator of success. The only difference is the container name (`fiedler-mcp`) and the command to run inside it (`fiedler`).

### Action Plan

1.  **Clean Slate:** Open `~/.claude.json` and `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json`. Delete any existing configuration blocks for `"fiedler"`.
2.  **Apply New Config:** Copy the JSON block provided above into the `mcpServers` section of your `~/.claude.json` file.
3.  **Restart Claude Code:** Completely shut down and restart the bare metal Claude Code application to force it to reload the new configuration.
4.  **Verify:**
    *   Open a new session in Claude Code.
    *   Attempt to use a Fiedler tool, for example, by typing `@fiedler list models`.
    *   The tool `mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models` should now be available and execute correctly.
    *   You should now see connection/activity logs when you run `docker logs fiedler-mcp`, as the `fiedler` process inside the container is now being correctly invoked.

This solution is directly derived from your architecture diagram and the evidence of your working `stdio`-based tools. It aligns the configuration with the immutable reality of your system.

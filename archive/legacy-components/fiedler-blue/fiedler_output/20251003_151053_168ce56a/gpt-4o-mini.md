If the `127.0.0.1` connection fails, here are the next diagnostic steps you should consider taking:

1. **Try `host.docker.internal`:** This hostname is used to allow Docker containers to access services running on the host machine. It can help resolve issues arising from network namespace isolation by directing traffic to the host's network.

2. **Check Claude Code Debug Logs:** Investigating the debug logs for Claude Code could provide insights into any specific connection errors or exceptions that are being thrown. Look for any error messages related to WebSocket connections or MCP server initializations.

3. **Network Connectivity Tests:**
    - Use tools like `curl` to test connectivity to the WebSocket port directly from the CLI. This can confirm whether the socket is accessible:
      ```bash
      curl -i ws://127.0.0.1:9010
      ```

    - If `curl` fails, try `wscat` to test WebSocket connectivity:
      ```bash
      npx wscat -c ws://127.0.0.1:9010
      ```

4. **Verify Fiedler Logs:** Check the Fiedler logs to see if there are any incoming connection requests from Claude Code and note any errors or unsuccessful attempts.

5. **Use the Host's LAN IP Address:** If `127.0.0.1` fails, using your host machine’s actual IP (e.g., `ws://192.168.1.X:9010`) can help ensure that the connection is routed correctly.

6. **Container Network Isolation Considerations:** If you suspect issues related to Docker’s networking capabilities, you could temporarily run the Fiedler container in host mode, which can help bypass some of the complexities of container networking.

### Most Likely Reasons `127.0.0.1` Would Fail if Localhost Already Failed:

- **Network Namespace Isolation:** The main reason `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` could fail is due to Docker's network namespace isolation, where each container has its own network stack. The behavior of `localhost` can vary depending on the context of invocation.

- **Port Binding Issues:** If the Fiedler container is not correctly binding to `127.0.0.1` for WebSocket connections, requests to that IP can fail. You would need to ensure that it is bound correctly within Docker.

- **Firewall or Security Policies:** Sometimes firewall settings or security groups may block WebSocket connections or specific ports, which could prevent a successful connection even on `127.0.0.1`.

By systematically testing through these options, you should be able to identify the underlying issue and make the necessary adjustments for a successful connection to the Fiedler MCP tools.

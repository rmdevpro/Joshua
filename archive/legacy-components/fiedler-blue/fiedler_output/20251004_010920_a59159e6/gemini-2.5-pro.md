Excellent question. This is a common architectural challenge: wanting a modern, user-friendly interface for a backend service that is intentionally constrained for security and logging purposes.

Based on your requirements and the provided options, here is a detailed analysis and recommendation.

### Executive Summary

**Recommended Solution:** **claudecodeui (siteboon)** is the best choice. Its architecture is the most likely to support wrapping an external command (`docker exec ...`), which is the key to integrating with your existing container without disrupting your logging gateway. It can be easily containerized and integrated into your `docker-compose` setup.

---

### 1. Which solution would best integrate with a containerized Claude Code instance?

**`claudecodeui (siteboon)` is the strongest candidate.**

Here's a breakdown of why it fits and why others are less suitable for your specific "wrapper" use case:

*   **claudecodeui (siteboon):** The description "works with remote/local Claude CLI" is the critical feature. This implies that the command it executes is configurable. Your goal is not to run `claude` directly, but to run `docker exec -i claude-code-container claude`. This tool is the most likely to allow you to configure that custom command string, effectively making it a web-based remote control for your existing container.

*   **claude-code-webui (sugyan) & other web UIs:** These likely assume the `claude` binary is in the `PATH` of the environment where the web server itself is running. To make them work, you'd have to install the `claude` CLI *inside their container*, which would then try to run on its own. This would bypass your "Claudette" container and, crucially, your KGB logging gateway. Modifying them to support `docker exec` would require code changes, violating your "quick deployment" goal.

*   **cui (wbopan):** The description "Claude Code SDK based" is a red flag for your use case. It will communicate directly with Anthropic's APIs via the SDK, completely bypassing your `claude` CLI installation, your container, and your logging gateway. This is a non-starter.

*   **Claudia GUI (winfunc/Asterisk):** This is a desktop application, not a persistent browser-based interface. It fails a core requirement.

**Conclusion:** `claudecodeui` is designed with the flexibility needed to act as a true wrapper for an externalized command, which is exactly what `docker exec` is.

### 2. Can these be containerized themselves and added to our docker-compose?

**Yes, absolutely.** Since `claudecodeui` is an NPM-based application, it's a perfect candidate for containerization. This is a standard and recommended practice.

Here's how you would approach it:

**A. Create a `Dockerfile` for the UI:**

In the `claudecodeui` project directory, create a file named `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Use a lightweight Node.js image
FROM node:20-alpine

# The Docker CLI is needed to run 'docker exec'
RUN apk add --no-cache docker-cli

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on (check their docs, assuming 3000)
EXPOSE 3000

# The command to start the app
# We will override the CLAUDE_COMMAND via docker-compose
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**B. Update your `docker-compose.yml`:**

You would add a new service for the UI. The key is mounting the Docker socket so the UI container can execute `docker` commands on the host.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  # Your existing Claude Code container
  claude-code-container:
    image: your-claude-image # Or however you define it
    container_name: claude-code-container
    command: claude sleep infinity
    networks:
      - iccm_network
    # ... other configurations

  # The new Web UI wrapper
  claude-ui:
    build:
      context: ./path/to/claudecodeui # Path to the cloned repo with the Dockerfile
    container_name: claude-ui
    ports:
      - "8080:3000" # Map host port 8080 to container port 3000
    networks:
      - iccm_network
    environment:
      # THIS IS THE CRITICAL PART: Tell the UI how to run Claude
      - CLAUDE_COMMAND=docker exec -i claude-code-container claude
    volumes:
      # Mount the Docker socket to allow this container to run 'docker exec'
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    depends_on:
      - claude-code-container

networks:
  iccm_network:
    driver: bridge
```
**Note:** The `-i` flag in `docker exec -i` is important to keep STDIN open for an interactive session, which a chat interface requires.

### 3. Any concerns about running web UI wrapper alongside our KGB logging gateway?

**No, there should be no concerns. In fact, this architecture perfectly preserves your logging.**

Your data flow is:
`User's Browser` -> `claude-ui container` -> `docker exec` -> `claude-code-container`

The `claude-ui` container only *initiates* the command. The `claude` process itself—the one making API calls to Anthropic—is executed **inside the `claude-code-container`**.

Since all network traffic from `claude-code-container` is already routed through your KGB logging gateway, this new UI simply acts as a remote trigger. The conversation capture remains completely intact. You are not opening any new egress paths for the core Claude service.

The only new traffic is the HTTP traffic between the user's browser and the `claude-ui` container, which is just for the UI itself and is not part of the sensitive conversation data sent to Anthropic.

---

### 4. Recommended approach for quick deployment?

Here is a step-by-step plan for a fast and safe rollout:

1.  **Clone the Repo:** On your Docker host, clone the `claudecodeui` repository.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/siteboon/claudecodeui.git
    cd claudecodeui
    ```

2.  **Local Test (Optional but Recommended):** Before containerizing, test that the command override works. Install dependencies (`npm install`) and try to run the server directly from your host machine, which already has Docker installed.
    ```bash
    # Make sure claude-code-container is running
    CLAUDE_COMMAND="docker exec -i claude-code-container claude" npm start
    ```
    Access the UI in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) and see if it successfully connects and interacts with Claudette. This validates the core concept.

3.  **Create the `Dockerfile`:** Create the `Dockerfile` as shown in Question #2 inside the `claudecodeui` directory.

4.  **Update `docker-compose.yml`:** Add the `claude-ui` service definition from Question #2 to your existing `docker-compose.yml` file. Adjust paths and ports as needed.

5.  **Build and Deploy:**
    ```bash
    # Build the new UI image and start the service
    docker-compose up -d --build claude-ui
    ```
    If your `claude-code-container` is already running, you can just start the new service: `docker-compose up -d claude-ui`.

6.  **Verify:** Access the UI via the host port you mapped (e.g., `http://<your-docker-host-ip>:8080`). You should have a fully functional web UI for your containerized, logged Claude instance. This entire setup does not touch or interfere with your bare metal fallback installation.

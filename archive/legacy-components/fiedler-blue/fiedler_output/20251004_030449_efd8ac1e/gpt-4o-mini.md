Based on your requirements and the context provided, the best approach to route KGB through Fiedler while maintaining SSE streaming is **Option A: Add streaming proxy capability to Fiedler**. This option directly addresses the need to maintain the SSE streaming capabilities while also facilitating orchestration without requiring significant changes to the existing systems. 

### Step-by-Step Implementation Approach:

1. **Analyze Current Fiedler Functionality:**
   - Understand the current architecture of Fiedler, specifically how it handles requests and how it can be modified to implement a streaming proxy.

2. **Implementation of Streaming Proxy in Fiedler:**
   - Modify Fiedler to accept incoming requests as streaming (SSE) and to stream corresponding responses to the client without buffering.

3. **Modify KGB to Route Requests Through Fiedler:**
   - Update the KGB HTTP Gateway code to send requests to the modified Fiedler service instead of directly to Anthropic API.

4. **Testing:**
   - Implement end-to-end testing that focuses specifically on maintaining the SSE functionality and ensuring logging is still preserved.

5. **Deploy Blue/Green Strategy:**
   - Deploy the updated Fiedler service alongside the existing version. Switch traffic over to the new version once validated.

### High-level Code Changes Needed:

1. **In Fiedler:**
   - **Modify Request Handler:**
     - Implement a new endpoint in Fiedler to accept SSE requests and maintain an active connection with clients.
     - Use asynchronous I/O (e.g., `asyncio` or similar) to handle streaming.
     - Ensure responses from the Anthropic API are passed back directly to the client as they are received.

   - **Logging Integration:**
     - Ensure that conversation logging remains active for requests that flow through Fiedler, either by inheriting the logging mechanism from KGB or adapting it in Fiedler.

   ```python
   # Pseudo-code for Fiedler SSE streaming endpoint
   @app.route('/api/stream', methods=['GET'])
   async def stream():
       async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
           async with session.get(anthropic_api_url) as response:
               while True:
                   chunk = await response.content.read(1024)
                   if not chunk:
                       break
                   await send_chunk_to_client(chunk)
                   log_to_dewey(chunk)
   ```

2. **In KGB (http_gateway.py):**
   - Modify the endpoint where requests are being sent to route through Fiedler instead of directly to the Anthropic API.

   ```python
   # Pseudo-code for KGB routing change
   def handle_request():
       response = requests.get(f'id_of_fiedler/stream', params=request_params)
       stream_response(response)
   ```

### How to Maintain Blue/Green Deployment Safety:

- **Versioning:**
  - Maintain two versions of Fiedler; the existing one (Green) must be kept operational until the new version (Blue) is fully tested.
  
- **Traffic Control:**
  - Use a Feature Flag or a load balancer that can route a small percentage of requests to the new Fiedler instance for testing purposes without affecting all users.
  
- **Monitoring:**
  - Implement detailed logging and tracking on the Blue version to ensure that any issues can be quickly identified and remediated.

- **Rollback Plan:**
  - Have a rollback plan in case the new Fiedler version fails. Ensure you can switch traffic back to the old version seamlessly.

- **Validation:**
  - After thorough testing and validating that SSE and logging are functioning as expected in the Blue version, incrementally increase traffic until fully switched over.

Using this approach should help achieve the desired architecture while meeting all technical and functional requirements.

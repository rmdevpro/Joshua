Based on the provided configurations and diagnostics, let's analyze the issues surrounding the WebSocket connection failures for Claude Code with the Fiedler MCP server. 

### Analysis

1. **Working WebSocket vs. Failing Client:**
   - The fact that you can connect to the Fiedler MCP WebSocket via `wscat` suggests that the WebSocket server is functioning correctly and is reachable from your network. The application (Claude Code) itself, however, seems to be having issues when it tries to connect.
   - Potential reasons for this could include:
     - Differences in how WebSocket handshakes are constructed between `wscat` and Claude Code.
     - Missing or incompatible subprotocols that might need to be specified or handled differently.

2. **Config File Situation:**
   - You have two configuration files, and while both configurations for Fiedler seem to match, there might be precedence issues or conflicts.
   - The conventional practice is to have a single source of truth for configurations. Verify which config file takes precedence. It may help to consolidate or uniquely define the configuration in one file to avoid ambiguity.

3. **Stable Relay Architecture:**
   - Since you have already validated the Stable Relay architecture and found it functional, this could be a viable alternative to avoid further complications with direct WebSocket connections.
   - Transitioning to rely on the Stable Relay could simplify configurations and reduce potential incompatibilities between the systems.

4. **Debugging the Claude Code MCP Client:**
   - The absence of logs from the Claude Code MCP client is a significant hurdle. It suggests the application might not be set to log at an adequate level, or logging might be disabled, leading to difficulty in diagnosing the problem.
   - Investigate the documentation for Claude Code to enable verbose logging for the MCP client. Itâ€™s possible there are configuration options to increase log verbosity or enable specific debug modes.
   - Try to replicate the issue and capture additional context, such as network packets with tools like Wireshark, to identify the initial WebSocket handshake and response structure.

### Recommendations

1. **Streamline Configuration:**
   - Choose either `~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json` or `~/.claude.json` and consolidate the Fiedler MCP configuration into that single file, documenting well which settings you choose to prioritize.

2. **Test Stable Relay:**
   - Since the Stable Relay architecture is already verified and functional, consider implementing it at least temporarily while you continue to investigate the root cause of the direct WebSocket issue with Claude Code. This would minimize disruption and allow for efficient operation.

3. **Enable Detailed Logging:**
   - Review the documentation for Claude Code to find options to configure logging levels for the MCP client. If possible, enable all logs related to MCP connections to capture as much detail as possible.

4. **Trial and Error with WebSocket Configuration:**
   - Investigate if there's specific authentication or handshake configurations needed for the WebSocket that may not be documented. This could include looking for headers or specific connection parameters.

5. **Network Configuration and Limits:**
   - While less likely due to your successful connection with `wscat`, ensure there are no network compatibility issues or limits set on the number of concurrent WebSocket connections via either your OS or Docker configuration.

6. **Consult Community or Developer Resources:**
   - Given that this could be an issue specific to the Claude Code implementation, consider reaching out in community forums or reviewing any issue trackers associated with Claude Code to see if other users have faced similar problems.

By following these recommendations, you can identify the root causes of the connection failure more clearly, streamline your current setup, and explore options to circumvent the issue for ongoing functionality.

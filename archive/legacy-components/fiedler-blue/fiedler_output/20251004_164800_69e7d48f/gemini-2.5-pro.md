## Final Validation Review

**Overall Status:** APPROVED

### Fixes Verification
- [✅] Context tracking fix correctly applied
- [✅] Logging enhancement correctly applied
- [✅] Subprocess request handling correctly applied
- [✅] context.dispose correctly applied

### Code Quality Assessment
The final code is of high quality and demonstrates excellent engineering practices. The fixes from the previous review have been integrated seamlessly and correctly, directly addressing the critical bugs identified. The codebase is now more robust, observable, and resilient. The structured logging, graceful error handling, and subprocess management are particularly well-implemented, meeting all Phase 1 requirements for production deployment.

### Final Recommendation
**APPROVE FOR PRODUCTION**

### Additional Notes
This implementation is a model for a reliable gateway service within the ICCM architecture. All previous concerns have been fully resolved. The logic for tracking client-specific browser contexts and ensuring their cleanup on disconnect is now robust and prevents the critical memory leak we identified. The enhanced logging will be invaluable for operational monitoring.

Congratulations to Marco on a successful final implementation. This service is ready for deployment.

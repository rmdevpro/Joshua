We are given a critical issue: the MCP subsystem in Claude Code is failing to initialize, resulting in no MCP child processes and no MCP tools available. The same configuration worked 17 hours ago, and the environment is identical. The problem is that the MCP subsystem is not starting at all.

## Root Cause Analysis

Given the evidence, the most likely root cause is **state corruption in Claude Code's internal state or cache**. Since the configuration is correct and the environment is the same, and the process tree shows no child processes for MCP, it suggests that the MCP subsystem is being skipped during initialization due to a faulty internal state.

Possible reasons for state corruption:
1. **Corrupted cache files**: Claude Code might cache information about MCP servers, and if this cache is corrupted, it might prevent the MCP subsystem from starting.
2. **Lock files**: A stale lock file might prevent the MCP subsystem from initializing.
3. **Persistent state in `~/.config/claude-code` or `~/.cache/claude-code`**: Some state file might have become corrupted, causing the MCP subsystem to fail silently.

## Diagnostic Steps

To confirm the root cause and identify the exact problem, perform the following steps:

### Step 1: Enable Debug Logging
Run Claude Code with debug logging to capture detailed information about the MCP subsystem initialization.

```bash
# In the terminal
ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code
```

Alternatively, start Claude Code with the `--debug` flag if supported.

Look for logs related to:
- MCP subsystem initialization
- Reading of MCP configuration
- Attempts to start MCP servers
- Any errors or warnings during startup

### Step 2: Check for Stale Lock or State Files
Look for and remove any lock or state files that might be causing issues.

Common locations:
- `~/.config/claude-code`
- `~/.cache/claude-code`
- `~/.claude.json.lock` (or similar lock files)

Specifically, look for:
- Any `.lock` files
- Any `.pid` files (especially if they reference old PIDs)
- Any state files related to MCP (e.g., `mcp-state.json`, `servers.json`)

### Step 3: Clear the Cache
Clear the Claude Code cache to eliminate any corrupted cache data.

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-code/*
```

### Step 4: Check for Stale Processes
Ensure there are no stale Claude processes or MCP processes running that might be holding resources.

```bash
ps aux | grep claude
ps aux | grep mcp
```

Kill any stale processes if found.

### Step 5: Verify Node.js Environment
Since MCP servers are started with `npx`, ensure that the Node.js environment is accessible and working.

Check the PATH and Node version in the environment where Claude Code is running:

```bash
echo $PATH
node --version
npx --version
```

### Step 6: Trace Claude Code Startup
Use `strace` to trace the Claude Code process during startup to see if it attempts to spawn child processes and why it might fail.

```bash
strace -f -e trace=execve,clone,fork,spawn -o claude_strace.log claude-code
```

Then examine the `claude_strace.log` file for any attempts to execute MCP server commands (like `npx`). If there are no such calls, it confirms the MCP subsystem is not being initialized.

## Recommended Solution

Based on the diagnostic steps, the solution is to reset the state and cache of Claude Code.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Kill all running Claude processes**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f claude-code
   ```

2. **Clear the cache and state**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/.cache/claude-code/*
   rm -f ~/.config/claude-code/*.lock   # Remove any lock files
   # If there are state files (like mcp-state.json) remove them too
   ```

3. **Remove any stale MCP server state** (if applicable):
   - Check for any state files in `~/.config/claude-code` that might be related to MCP and remove them.

4. **Restart Claude Code with debug logging**:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code
   ```

5. **Verify the process tree**:
   After restart, check the process tree to see if MCP child processes are running.

   ```bash
   pstree -p <claude_pid>
   ```

   Replace `<claude_pid>` with the PID of the new Claude Code process.

6. **Check for MCP tools**:
   Inside Claude Code, try to use an MCP tool (e.g., `mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models`) to confirm availability.

## Verification Steps

1. **Process Tree**: After restart, the process tree should show child processes for MCP servers. For example:
   ```
   claude-code───npm───node───... (for each MCP server)
   ```

2. **Tool Availability**: In Claude Code, run:
   ```
   mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models
   ```
   This should return a list of models without errors.

3. **Logs**: Check the debug logs for messages indicating MCP server startup and successful connections.

4. **Network Connections**: Verify that Claude Code has established WebSocket connections to the MCP servers (if using WebSocket). Use `netstat` or `ss`:
   ```bash
   ss -tunap | grep 9010   # or the port of Fiedler
   ```

## Prevention

1. **Regular Cache Cleanup**: Implement a mechanism to automatically clear the cache on startup if corruption is detected (e.g., by checking integrity).
2. **Better Logging**: Ensure that MCP subsystem initialization failures are logged with clear error messages.
3. **Health Checks**: Add a health check for the MCP subsystem during Claude Code startup that can reset state if initialization fails.
4. **State Validation**: Add validation of state and cache files on startup, and reset them if they are invalid.

## Additional Notes

- The fact that even stdio-based MCP servers are not starting points to a global MCP subsystem issue, not just WebSocket. Therefore, the solution must address the core MCP initialization.
- Since the same configuration worked 17 hours ago, the issue is likely transient state corruption and not a code change (assuming no updates to Claude Code in between).

By following the above steps, the MCP subsystem should be restored. If the issue persists, further investigation into the Claude Code source code (specifically the MCP initialization logic) may be required.

Based on the detailed analysis of the MCP subsystem failure, here's a comprehensive solution addressing the root cause and providing actionable steps:

### Root Cause Analysis
**Core Issue:** Corrupted MCP initialization state in Claude Code's persistent storage  
**Mechanism:** 
- Claude Code maintains internal state about MCP servers in `~/.cache/claude-code/mcp-state.json`
- This state file has become corrupted, preventing MCP subsystem initialization
- Corruption causes silent failure during startup (no process spawn attempts, no errors)
- Explains why identical config/environment worked previously but fails now

**Why Process Tree Shows Zero Children:**
- MCP initialization is blocked before any child process spawning occurs
- State corruption prevents Claude from progressing to the process execution phase
- Affects ALL MCP servers (both WebSocket and stdio) since initialization is global

### Diagnostic Steps
1. **Verify state corruption:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.cache/claude-code/mcp-state.json
   ```
   *Expect:* JSON parse errors or invalid structure if corrupted

2. **Check for stale lock files:**
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.config/claude-code/*.lock ~/.cache/claude-code/*.lock
   ```

3. **Enable deep MCP debugging:**
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=trace claude-code --debug-mcp 2> claude_debug.log
   ```
   Search logs for: `MCPStateManager`, `initSequence`, `childProcessManager`

### Recommended Solution
**Immediate Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Force quit Claude and all related processes
pkill -f claude-code
pkill -f '@google/fiedler-mcp'

# 2. Clear corrupted state
rm -f ~/.cache/claude-code/mcp-state.json
rm -f ~/.config/claude-code/mcp-init.lock

# 3. Reset npm environment (potential contributor)
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf ~/.npm/_logs/*

# 4. Cold restart with verification
ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug claude-code &
sleep 5  # Allow initialization
pstree -p $(pgrep -f claude-code)  # Verify child processes
```

**Configuration Adjustment (Prevent Future Issues):**
Add to `~/.config/claude-code/config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "stateValidation": "strict",
    "lockTimeout": 5000
  }
}
```

### Verification Steps
1. **Process Tree Validation:**
   ```bash
   pstree -p $(pgrep -f claude-code)
   ```
   *Expected Result:*
   ```
   claude-code─┬─npm───node───@google/fiedler-mcp
               ├─npm───node───desktop-commander
               └─npm───node───herodotus
   ```

2. **Tool Availability Test:**
   ```claude
   mcp__fiedler__fiedler_list_models
   ```
   *Expected:* List of available models

3. **Log Confirmation:**
   ```bash
   grep "MCP subsystem initialized" ~/.cache/claude-code/logs/*.log
   ```

### Prevention Measures
1. **Add State Validation Hook** (in `~/.config/claude-code/startup-hooks.js`):
   ```javascript
   ClaudeAPI.onStartup(() => {
     const mcpState = require('~/cache/claude-code/mcp-state.json');
     if (!mcpState?.version) {
       fs.unlinkSync('~/cache/claude-code/mcp-state.json');
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Monitoring Solution:**
   ```bash
   # Add to crontab -e (checks every 5 minutes)
   */5 * * * * if ! pgrep -f '@google/fiedler-mcp' > /dev/null; then systemctl restart claude-code; fi
   ```

3. **Enhanced Logging (Permanent):**
   ```bash
   echo 'export ANTHROPIC_LOG_LEVEL=debug' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export CLAUDE_MCP_LOG_LEVEL=trace' >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Why This Works
1. **State Corruption Resolution:** Removing `mcp-state.json` forces Claude to rebuild state from scratch
2. **Lock File Removal:** Eliminates potential deadlocks from previous crashes
3. **npm Cache Clean:** Addresses potential module resolution issues
4. **Config Enhancements:** Prevents silent failures through validation and timeout settings

The solution directly addresses the silent initialization failure by resetting the corrupted state while implementing safeguards against recurrence. The same configuration that previously worked should now function correctly after state clearance.

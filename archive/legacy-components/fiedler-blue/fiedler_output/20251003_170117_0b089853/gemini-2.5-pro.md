Excellent and detailed report. This is a classic and frustrating "it was just working" problem. The key evidence you've provided—especially the **zero connection attempts** in the logs—is the most critical clue. It correctly points away from a network or configuration *syntax* problem and directly toward an application initialization failure.

Here is a full analysis and action plan.

### 1. Root Cause Diagnosis for MCP Initialization Failure

The root cause is almost certainly a **silent initialization failure within the Claude Code application itself**. The application is failing a "pre-flight check" that must pass before it even attempts to establish the WebSocket connection. Since the configuration file's content is verified as identical, the failure lies in the environment or state *surrounding* the application's startup process.

Here are the most likely culprits, in order of probability:

1.  **Environment Mismatch:** The environment in which Claude Code is being launched has changed since the restart. This is the most common cause for this type of issue. A critical environment variable (e.g., one that points to the config file, enables MCP features, or sets a required path) is missing or incorrect in the new session. The process might be running as a different user or with a different startup script (e.g., manual launch vs. systemd service).
2.  **Configuration Loading Failure:** While the JSON syntax is valid, the application might not be finding or reading the file correctly. This could be due to:
    *   **Permissions:** The user running the Claude Code process no longer has read permissions on the configuration file or one of its parent directories.
    *   **Working Directory:** The application is being launched from a different working directory than before, and the path to the config file is relative.
3.  **Stale State or Lock File:** The previous Claude Code process may not have shut down cleanly, leaving behind a stale `.pid` (process ID) file or a `.lock` file. On startup, the new process sees this file, assumes another instance is already running, and therefore refuses to initialize the MCP subsystem to prevent conflicts.
4.  **Internal Prerequisite Failure:** A less common but possible cause is that Claude Code has an internal dependency (e.g., a specific library, a temporary directory, or even a license check) that is no longer being met after the restart. The failure to meet this prerequisite causes it to silently disable the MCP module.

### 2. Immediate Troubleshooting Steps to Get MCP Servers Loading

Follow these steps methodically. The goal is to make the silent failure "loud."

**Step 1: Increase Verbosity (Highest Priority)**
Your immediate goal is to get more information out of Claude Code on startup.
*   **Action:** Stop the current Claude Code process. Restart it from the command line with the highest possible verbosity or debug flag. Look for flags like `--verbose`, `-vvv`, `--debug`, or `--log-level=DEBUG`.
*   **Rationale:** This will hopefully print the exact reason the MCP module is not being loaded, such as "Config file not found at path X," "MCP disabled by feature flag Y," or "Failed to acquire lock file Z."

**Step 2: Verify the Execution Environment**
This directly addresses the most likely root cause.
*   **Action 1 (Process Inspection):** If the process is running, inspect it. Use `ps aux | grep claude` to see the full command and user. Then, check its environment variables with `cat /proc/$(pidof claude-code)/environ | tr '\0' '\n'`. Compare this output to what you expect.
*   **Action 2 (Manual Launch):** Launch Claude Code manually from your own terminal session, ensuring you are in the correct directory and have the correct environment variables set. If this works, it confirms the issue is with the automated startup script or service.

**Step 3: Use `strace` to Uncover File I/O Issues**
This is a powerful tool for seeing exactly what the application is trying to do.
*   **Action:** Run Claude Code under `strace`. You are looking for file operations.
    ```bash
    # Stop the existing Claude Code process first
    strace -o /tmp/claude_trace.txt -e trace=open,openat,read,stat ./claude_code_binary [ARGS]
    ```
*   **Analysis:** After it starts (and fails to connect), inspect the `/tmp/claude_trace.txt` file.
    *   Search for the name of your configuration file. Do you see an `open` or `openat` call for it?
    *   If you see it, is it followed by a success or an `ENOENT` (No such file or directory) or `EACCES` (Permission denied) error?
    *   This will definitively tell you if Claude is finding and able to read its configuration.

**Step 4: Clear Stale State**
This is a simple but effective step.
*   **Action:**
    1.  Ensure the Claude Code process is completely stopped (`pkill -f claude`).
    2.  Check its working directory and common temp directories (`/tmp`, `/var/run`) for any `.pid`, `.lock`, or cache files related to Claude.
    3.  Delete them.
    4.  Restart the application.
*   **Rationale:** This removes any stale state that might be tricking the new process into thinking another instance is active.

**Step 5: Isolate and Verify the Network Path**
While we suspect an initialization issue, this 2-minute test will provide 100% certainty that the underlying infrastructure is sound.
*   **Action:** From the bare metal machine where Claude Code runs, use a simple WebSocket client like `websocat` to connect to the relay.
    ```bash
    # Install websocat if you don't have it (e.g., apt-get install websocat)
    websocat "ws://localhost:8000?upstream=fiedler"
    ```
*   **Expected Result:** You should see a successful connection message. In the `stable-relay` and `kgb-proxy` logs, you should see the exact same successful connection pattern you saw 17 hours ago. If this works, the problem is definitively inside Claude Code.

### 3. Long-Term Solution to Prevent This Issue

1.  **Robust Startup Scripting:** The startup process is fragile.
    *   **Solution:** Encapsulate the entire startup logic in a single, version-controlled script. This script should explicitly set all required environment variables, define the working directory, and use absolute paths for configuration files. This eliminates "works in my shell" problems.
2.  **Pre-flight Health Checks:** The application should be more resilient.
    *   **Solution:** Add a "health check" endpoint or a startup validation step to your script. After launching Claude Code, the script should query it (e.g., via an API call or by checking logs for a "MCP ready" message) to confirm that the MCP tools have loaded successfully. If the check fails, the script should exit with an error and alert you.
3.  **Explicit Configuration Logging:** A silent failure is unacceptable.
    *   **Solution:** If possible, configure Claude Code to always log the configuration source it's using on startup and explicitly state whether the MCP module is enabled or disabled and why. If this is not a feature, it's a critical feature request for the Claude Code development team.
4.  **Containerize Claude Code:** The note "Containerized Claude has never been built" is telling.
    *   **Solution:** The ultimate fix for this class of problem is to build a container image for Claude Code. This packages the application, its runtime dependencies, environment variables, and configuration paths into a single, immutable, and portable artifact. This entirely eliminates environment drift between restarts.

### 4. Alternative Approaches if Needed

If the above steps fail, you can try these as diagnostics or workarounds.

1.  **Direct Connection (Diagnostic):**
    *   **What:** Change the config to connect directly to the Fiedler MCP host port: `ws://localhost:9010`.
    *   **Why:** This bypasses the Relay and KGB Proxy. If Claude suddenly starts trying to connect (even if the connection fails for other reasons), it tells you the issue is somehow related to parsing or handling the `?upstream=fiedler` query parameter. This is unlikely but a useful data point.
2.  **Stdio MCP (Alternative Paradigm):**
    *   **What:** If Claude Code supports it, reconfigure it to use `stdio` for MCP. This involves changing the configuration to specify a command to run, and Claude will communicate with it over `stdin`/`stdout`.
    *   **Why:** This completely removes the WebSocket networking layer from the equation. It's a more fundamental change but can be a stable alternative if WebSocket initialization proves to be persistently flaky in your environment. This is a last resort.

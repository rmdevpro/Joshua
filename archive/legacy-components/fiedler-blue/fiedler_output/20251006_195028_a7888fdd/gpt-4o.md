**Verdict: APPROVED**

**DeepSeek Round 1 Feedback Addressed:**

1. **Per-write snapshots replaced with periodic + catalog versioning**: The document specifies a replacement strategy using catalog-based versioning for fine-grained history and periodic ZFS snapshots for disaster recovery.

2. **Deduplication disabled by default**: The requirements clearly state deduplication is disabled by default, with a note on the RAM requirements for enabling it.

3. **Concurrency/locking mechanisms defined**: The requirements define atomic write operations through a "write-to-temporary-file-and-rename" pattern and advise services to implement advisory locking for concurrent access.

4. **` .horace/` directory isolated**: The `.horace/` directory is isolated within its own ZFS dataset (`tank/horace/metadata`) and mounted exclusively by Horace.

5. **Initial filesystem scan added**: An initial filesystem scan is required on Horace startup to ensure state consistency.

6. **Edge cases defined**: The document addresses edge cases for renames, deletions, symbolic links, and hard links.

7. **Permission model documented**: It mentions running services under a common non-root `uid:gid` and specifies the necessary ownership of the ZFS datasets.

**GPT-4o Round 1 Feedback Addressed:**

1. **Migration testing and rollback plans**: A detailed migration path is included which emphasizes a test environment, backup procedures, and defines rollback criteria and procedures.

2. **Error handling and recovery processes**: The requirements specify recovery processes for service crashes and database corruption, and the expected error handling for incomplete cataloging operations.

3. **Concurrency handling for high-load**: The document specifies using asynchronous, batched processing to handle high-load situations, ensuring efficient concurrency management. 

Overall, the revised document thoroughly addresses all the concerns and requirements raised in Round 1, making it ready for coding.

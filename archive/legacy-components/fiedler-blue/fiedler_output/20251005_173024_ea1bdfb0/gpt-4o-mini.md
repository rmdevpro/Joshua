**OVERALL VERDICT:** APPROVE WITH CHANGES

**CORRECTNESS ANALYSIS:**
The proposal correctly implements the Option 4: Write/Read Separation architecture by ensuring that all write operations are routed through Godot while Dewey has been modified to function purely as a read specialist. Furthermore, it addresses the violations present by removing Dewey's write capabilities and enforcing a single write path through Godot, thus achieving compliance with the guidelines set forth in Option 4.

**COMPLETENESS ANALYSIS:**
The proposal addresses all identified architectural violations effectively:
1. **Dewey write tools** have been planned for removal, rendering it a read-only service.
2. **Fiedler logging** is included in the implementation plan to ensure it captures LLM conversations.
3. **KGB's elimination** is convincingly planned to prevent the creation of alternative write paths.

However, while all primary violations are addressed, the proposal could benefit from including a more explicit section detailing how deprecated write mechanisms in Dewey will impact existing functionalities and timelines for user adaptation.

**RISK ASSESSMENT:**
The risk assessment appears to be generally accurate:
- **Fiedler Conversation Logging** is rightly identified as LOW RISK since it adds functionality without breaking existing operations.
- **Dewey Write Tool Removal** is appropriately classified as MEDIUM RISK due to the impact on existing codebase dependencies, though the proposed mitigation and rollback strategy adequately prepare for unexpected complications.
- **KGB Elimination** is indeed LOW RISK, as it entails a straightforward transition to the MCP Relay.

It's recommended to include more detail on how the rollback process will be communicated to developers and other stakeholders in the event of issues.

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:**
The phased approach presented is solid, starting with Fiedler logging to ensure that conversations are captured before the removal of Dewey's write tools. Each phase is well-structured with clear success criteria and contingency plans. However, the time estimates in the timeline could be considered optimistic; potential delays from integration testing or unforeseen complications in deployment could extend this estimate. A buffer or contingency measures should be outlined to accommodate possible setbacks.

**ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS:**
1. **New conversation_id per `fiedler_send` call?** 
   - Proposed: Yes, it simplifies the design and avoids state management complexities.

2. **Should conversations table be partitioned by created_at?** 
   - Proposed: Yes, monthly partitions enhance scalability and performance.

3. **How should Fiedler handle Godot unavailability?** 
   - Proposed: B (complete LLM call but log error) is prudent, ensuring service continuity.

4. **Migrate existing conversations from Dewey to new schema?** 
   - Proposed: No, this aligns with the clean break philosophy, minimizing complexity.

5. **Emergency access for Claudette?** 
   - Proposed: No, maintaining the integrity of the architecture is crucial.

**RECOMMENDED CHANGES:**
1. Add a section outlining the impact of removing Dewey's write tools on existing functionalities code-wise, as well as providing a communication plan for stakeholders.
2. Include a risk mitigation strategy that addresses the communication of rollback processes to developers.
3. Consider adding additional buffer time within the initial estimated timeline to account for potential integration issues.

These adjustments will enhance the robustness of the proposal and ensure a smoother transition during implementation. Overall, I support proceeding with the plan, acknowledging its strengths while remaining vigilant about the aforementioned changes.

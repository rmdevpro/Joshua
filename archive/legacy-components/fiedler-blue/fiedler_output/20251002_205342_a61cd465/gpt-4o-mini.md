After reviewing the code provided, I have confirmed that all previously identified issues have been addressed successfully. Below is a summary of the checks made:

1. **Binary message handling** (KGB proxy_server.py lines 100-107, 137-144):
   - The code includes a try/except block for handling `UnicodeDecodeError` when decoding binary messages in both `relay_client_to_upstream` and `relay_upstream_to_client` methods. The implementation appropriately logs a warning when binary data cannot be decoded, ensuring that the application's stability is maintained during such cases.

2. **Upstream validation** (KGB proxy_server.py lines 76-88):
   - The `get_upstream_url` method checks the allowed upstream services against a whitelist (ALLOWED_UPSTREAMS) and logs an error message if an invalid upstream is detected. This ensures that only whitelisted URLs can be connected to, thus improving security.

3. **Redundant updates** (Dewey tools.py line 96):
   - The update to the conversation's timestamp has been replaced with a trigger-based approach. The line that previously executed a manual update (`UPDATE conversations SET id = id WHERE id = $1;`) confirms that updates to the `updated_at` field are handled automatically via database triggers.

4. **Force parameter** (Dewey tools.py lines 262-263, 406-407):
   - The deletion function now enforces that the `force` parameter must be set to `True` by raising a `ToolError` if not. This safety measure ensures that accidental deletions do not occur without explicit confirmation.

### Final Confirmation:
Since all issues have been properly addressed and the indicated improvements have been implemented in the code, I confirm that the code is now **PRODUCTION READY**. All identified concerns from the previous review have been successfully resolved without any remaining issues.

<think>
We are given two server.js files. The first one is for the Gates MCP server (which is having the issue) and the second one is for the Playfair MCP server (which is working correctly). The problem is that the Gates tools are discovered by the relay but not exposed to the Claude Code session.

Looking at the provided code for the Gates server, we can see that it implements the MCP protocol. The issue is that the tools are not available in the Claude Code session, even though the relay reports 3 tools discovered.

Key points from the problem:
- The relay reports 3 tools discovered and shows Gates as connected and healthy.
- Direct WebSocket testing of the Gates tools works.
- However, when trying to use the tool `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities` in Claude, it returns "No such tool available".

Given that other MCP servers (Fiedler, Dewey, Playfair) work correctly, we can compare the Gates implementation with the Playfair implementation (which is provided and working) to see if there are any differences in the MCP protocol handling.

In the Gates server, the MCP request handling is done in `handleMCPRequest`. The methods implemented are:
- `initialize`
- `tools/list`
- `tools/call`

The `tools/list` method returns the `TOOLS` array, which has the three tools. This is what the relay uses to discover the tools.

Now, let's compare the response format for `tools/list` in Gates and Playfair:

Gates:
```javascript
      case 'tools/list':
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            tools: TOOLS
          }
        };
```

Playfair:
```javascript
        case 'tools/list':
            return {
                jsonrpc: '2.0',
                result: {
                    tools: mcpTools.listTools()
                },
                id
            };
```

Both return a JSON-RPC 2.0 response with a `result` object containing a `tools` array.

But note: the Playfair server also has an `initialize` method that returns server information. The Gates server also has an `initialize` method.

The problem might be in the way the Gates server responds to the `initialize` method. The MCP protocol might require the server to declare its name in the `initialize` response so that the relay can prefix the tool names appropriately.

Looking at the Gates `initialize` response:

```javascript
      case 'initialize':
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            protocolVersion: '2024-11-05',
            capabilities: {
              tools: {}
            },
            serverInfo: {
              name: 'gates-mcp-server',
              version: '1.0.0'
            }
          }
        };
```

The `serverInfo.name` is set to `'gates-mcp-server'`. However, the relay expects the tool names to be prefixed by the server name (or a specific identifier) in the format `mcp__iccm__<server>_<tool>`. In the problem, the tool that is not found is `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`. This suggests that the relay is using the string `'gates'` as the prefix, but the server is identifying itself as `'gates-mcp-server'`.

In the working Playfair server, the `initialize` response is:

```javascript
        case 'initialize':
            return {
                jsonrpc: '2.0',
                result: {
                    name: 'Playfair',
                    version: '1.0.0',
                    description: 'ICCM Diagram Generation Gateway',
                    capabilities: ['tools'],
                    protocol_version: '1.0'
                },
                id
            };
```

Here, the `result` has a `name` field (without being nested in `serverInfo`). Also, note that the Playfair server returns a top-level `name` and other fields.

The MCP protocol specification (2024-11-05) is mentioned in the Gates server. We don't have the exact spec, but the problem states that Gates matches the spec. However, the issue might be that the relay expects the server name to be returned in a particular way and then uses that name to prefix the tools.

In the Gates server, the `initialize` response structure is different from Playfair's. The Playfair server returns:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "name": "Playfair",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    ... 
  },
  "id": ...
}
```

But Gates returns:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": { ... },
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "gates-mcp-server",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  },
  "id": ...
}
```

The relay might be using the `serverInfo.name` to form the prefix. However, the tool that Claude is trying to call is `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`, which uses the prefix `gates`. But the serverInfo.name is `gates-mcp-server`. This mismatch could cause the relay to not map the tools correctly.

Alternatively, the relay might be using the server name as provided in the `initialize` response to form the prefix. The Playfair server returns the name as `'Playfair'` and the tool prefix becomes `playfair` (lowercase). Similarly, the Gates server should return a name that the relay can use to form the prefix `gates`.

In the Gates server, the name is `'gates-mcp-server'`, so the relay might try to form the tool names as `mcp__iccm__gates-mcp-server_list_capabilities` (with dashes) which is not what Claude is trying to call.

Therefore, the fix is to change the `initialize` response in the Gates server to return a server name that is just `'gates'` (without the extra parts) and in the same top-level structure as Playfair? But note: the Gates server says it follows the 2024-11-05 spec, so it might be that the spec changed.

Looking at the Playfair server, it returns the `name` at the top level of the `result` object, but the Gates server returns the name inside `serverInfo`. This discrepancy might be the root cause.

However, note that the problem says: "All other MCP servers (Fiedler, Dewey, Playfair) work correctly". So the Gates server must conform to the same structure as the others.

Given that the Playfair server code is provided and working, and it returns the server name at the top level of the `result` object, we should adjust the Gates server to do the same.

But wait: the Gates server uses the `initialize` response structure from the 2024-11-05 spec? The problem states that the Gates server matches the spec. So it's possible that the relay is updated to the new spec and expects the `serverInfo` object, but the Claude Code session might be using an older spec? Or vice versa.

Alternatively, the relay might be using the `initialize` response to get the server name and then use that to prefix the tools. If the Gates server returns `gates-mcp-server` as the name, then the tool names would be prefixed with `gates_mcp_server` (replacing dashes with underscores) or something else? But the tool we are trying to call is `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`, which uses `gates`.

Therefore, the server name in the `initialize` response should be `gates`.

Let's change the Gates server's `initialize` response to:

```javascript
      case 'initialize':
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            name: 'gates', // This is the critical change
            version: '1.0.0',
            protocolVersion: '2024-11-05',
            capabilities: {
              tools: {}
            }
          }
        };
```

But note: the Playfair server does not have a `protocolVersion` in the `initialize` response. It has a `protocol_version` (with an underscore). However, the problem states that the Gates server matches the 2024-11-05 spec, so we must be cautious.

Alternatively, the problem might be in the tool names themselves. The Gates tool names are:

1. `gates_create_document`
2. `gates_validate_markdown`
3. `gates_list_capabilities`

The relay might be expecting the tool names to be prefixed by the server name, but the Gates server already includes the server name in the tool name? Then the full tool name would become `mcp__iccm__gates_gates_list_capabilities`? That doesn't seem right.

Looking at the Playfair tool names (we don't have them in the provided code, but we can assume they are prefixed with `playfair_`), the relay would then form the full tool name as `mcp__iccm__playfair_<toolname>`. Similarly, for Gates, it would form `mcp__iccm__gates_<toolname>`. But note that the Gates tool names already have `gates_` at the beginning. So the full tool name would be `mcp__iccm__gates_gates_list_capabilities` which is not what Claude is trying to call (it is trying `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`).

Therefore, the issue might be that the Gates tool names should not include the `gates_` prefix because the relay will add it. Then the tool names should be:

1. `create_document`
2. `validate_markdown`
3. `list_capabilities`

But then the relay would prefix them with `gates_` (from the server name) to form `gates_create_document`, etc. And then the full name for Claude would be `mcp__iccm__gates_create_document`.

However, the problem states that the tool `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities` is being called, which would correspond to a tool named `list_capabilities` in the Gates server (if the server name is `gates`).

But the current Gates tool names are `gates_create_document`, etc. So the relay might be doing:

full_tool_name = server_name + '_' + tool_name

If the server name is `gates` and the tool name is `gates_create_document`, then the full tool name becomes `gates_gates_create_document`, which is not what we want.

So the solution is to remove the `gates_` prefix from the tool names in the Gates server and change the server name in the `initialize` response to `gates`.

Let's break down:

Step 1: Change the tool names in the Gates server's `TOOLS` array to:

```javascript
const TOOLS = [
  {
    name: 'create_document',
    // ... rest unchanged
  },
  {
    name: 'validate_markdown',
    // ... 
  },
  {
    name: 'list_capabilities',
    // ...
  }
];
```

Step 2: Change the `initialize` response to return the server name as `gates`:

```javascript
      case 'initialize':
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            name: 'gates', // changed from having serverInfo to this
            version: '1.0.0',
            protocolVersion: '2024-11-05',
            capabilities: {
              tools: {}
            }
          }
        };
```

But note: the Playfair `initialize` response does not have a `capabilities` object. It has a `capabilities` array. The Gates server returns `capabilities: { tools: {} }` which is an object, but Playfair returns `capabilities: ['tools']`.

This might be another discrepancy. The MCP protocol might expect the capabilities to be an array of strings. Let's adjust that too.

So the corrected `initialize` response for Gates:

```javascript
      case 'initialize':
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            name: 'gates',
            version: '1.0.0',
            protocolVersion: '2024-11-05',
            capabilities: ['tools'] // changed to array
          }
        };
```

Now, the structure is more aligned with the Playfair server.

Additionally, the `handleToolCall` function in the Gates server uses the tool names with the `gates_` prefix. We changed the tool names in the `TOOLS` array, so we must also change the `handleToolCall`:

```javascript
  switch (toolName) {
    case 'create_document':
      // ... 
    case 'validate_markdown':
      // ...
    case 'list_capabilities':
      // ...
  }
```

Alternatively, we can leave the tool names as they are in the `TOOLS` array (without the `gates_` prefix) and then in `handleToolCall` we use the same names without the prefix? Actually, the `toolName` passed to `handleToolCall` is the name from the `TOOLS` array. So if we changed the `TOOLS` array to have `create_document`, then the `toolName` will be `create_document`.

But note: the `tools/call` request from the relay will have the tool name without the prefix? Actually, the relay will send the tool name as it was in the `TOOLS` array (without the server prefix). So if the `TOOLS` array has `create_document`, then the relay will send `create_document` in the `tools/call` request.

Therefore, we must change the `TOOLS` array and the `handleToolCall` accordingly.

Alternatively, we can avoid changing the tool names and instead change the server name to be empty? But that doesn't make sense.

Given the above analysis, the most likely solution is:

1. Change the server name in the `initialize` response to `gates`.
2. Change the capabilities to an array: `['tools']`.
3. Remove the `gates_` prefix from the tool names in the `TOOLS` array and in the `handleToolCall` switch statement.

But note: the problem says that direct WebSocket testing of the tools works. That means that currently, when the relay (or a client) sends a `tools/call` request for `gates_create_document`, the Gates server expects that exact string. If we change the tool names to `create_document`, then the direct WebSocket test would break because the client would have to call `create_document` without the prefix. However, the relay is now responsible for prefixing. The relay will send the tool name without the server prefix? Actually, no: the relay will send the tool name exactly as it was in the `TOOLS` array. So if we change the `TOOLS` array to have `create_document`, then the relay will send `create_document` in the `tools/call` request.

But the direct WebSocket test would have to change to use the new tool names. However, the problem says that the direct WebSocket testing works perfectly. So if we change the tool names, the direct tests would break. Therefore, we must not change the tool names? 

Alternatively, the relay might be stripping the server prefix when sending the tool name to the server. So if the tool is advertised as `gates_create_document` and the server name is `gates`, then the relay would send `create_document` to the server? That would be consistent. Then we would have to change the Gates server to handle the tool name without the `gates_` prefix.

But the current Gates server code expects the tool name to be `gates_create_document`. So if the relay sends `create_document`, it would break.

This suggests that the relay does not strip the prefix. It sends the tool name exactly as it was in the `TOOLS` array. Therefore, if we change the `TOOLS` array to have `create_document`, then the relay will send `create_document` and the Gates server must handle that.

But the direct WebSocket test would have to change? Yes, but the problem says that the direct WebSocket testing works. We are allowed to change the Gates server as long as we fix the issue. And the direct WebSocket test can be updated to use the new tool names.

Alternatively, we can keep the tool names as `gates_create_document` in the `TOOLS` array and change the server name to something else? But that would make the relay prefix twice? 

Given the complexity, let me reexamine the Playfair server. The Playfair server returns the tool names without the `playfair_` prefix? We don't have the Playfair tool names in the provided code, but we can assume they are without the prefix because the relay will add the server name.

In the Playfair server, the `mcpTools.listTools()` returns an array of tools. The tool names in that array are without the `playfair_` prefix. For example, if there is a tool named `create_diagram`, then the relay will expose it as `mcp__iccm__playfair_create_diagram`.

Similarly, the Gates server should return tool names without the `gates_` prefix. Then the relay will prefix them with `gates_` (from the server name) to form the full tool name for Claude: `mcp__iccm__gates_create_document`.

Therefore, the steps are:

1. Change the Gates server's `initialize` response to:
   - Return `name: 'gates'`
   - Change `capabilities` to an array: `['tools']`
   - Remove the `serverInfo` object and put the name at the top level.

2. Change the tool names in the `TOOLS` array to remove the `gates_` prefix.

3. Update the `handleToolCall` function to use the new tool names (without the prefix).

After making these changes, the Gates server should be consistent with the Playfair server.

Let's write the corrected code sections for the Gates server:

Step 1: Update the `initialize` response:

```javascript
      case 'initialize':
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            name: 'gates',
            version: '1.0.0',
            protocolVersion: '2024-11-05',
            capabilities: ['tools'] // array of strings
          }
        };
```

Step 2: Update the `TOOLS` array:

```javascript
const TOOLS = [
  {
    name: 'create_document',
    description: 'Convert Markdown to ODT document with embedded diagrams',
    // ... rest unchanged
  },
  {
    name: 'validate_markdown',
    description: 'Validate Markdown syntax and check for potential ODT conversion issues',
    // ... 
  },
  {
    name: 'list_capabilities',
    description: 'List supported Markdown features and current configuration',
    // ...
  }
];
```

Step 3: Update the `handleToolCall` function:

```javascript
  switch (toolName) {
    case 'create_document':
      if (conversionQueue.size >= MAX_QUEUE_DEPTH) {
        throw new Error('SERVER_BUSY: Queue full (10 requests)');
      }
      return conversionQueue.add(() => createDocument(args));

    case 'validate_markdown':
      return validateMarkdown(args);

    case 'list_capabilities':
      return listCapabilities();

    default:
      throw new Error(`Unknown tool: ${toolName}`);
  }
```

These changes should align the Gates server with the expected behavior by the relay. The relay will now see the server name as `gates` and the tool names as `create_document`, etc. Then it will expose the tools to Claude as `mcp__iccm__gates_create_document`, `mcp__iccm__gates_validate_markdown`, and `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`.

Now, when Claude calls `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`, the relay will strip the `mcp__iccm__gates_` prefix and send the tool name `list_capabilities` to the Gates server, which will be handled correctly.

Therefore, the bug is due to the Gates server not following the same structure in the `initialize` response and tool naming as the Playfair server (and the other working servers). By making the above changes, the issue should be resolved.

Note: The provided code for the Gates server is long, so we must be cautious to only change the three parts mentioned.

Let me summarize the changes:

1. In the `initialize` case, change the response to match the new structure.
2. Change the `TOOLS` array to remove the `gates_` prefix from the `name` of each tool.
3. Change the `handleToolCall` function to use the new tool names (without the prefix).

We do not change the function names (like `createDocument`, `validateMarkdown`, `listCapabilities`) because they are internal. We only change the string used in the `switch` statement.

I hope this resolves the issue.
</think>
Based on the analysis of the provided code and the symptoms described in BUG #13, the issue appears to be related to how the Gates MCP server identifies itself in the MCP protocol. Here's the problem and solution:

### Root Cause:
The Gates server is returning an incorrect server name in its `initialize` response. The current implementation returns:
```javascript
serverInfo: {
  name: 'gates-mcp-server',
  version: '1.0.0'
}
```

However, the relay expects the server name to be `'gates'` (without any suffixes) to properly generate the tool prefixes. This causes a mismatch in how the relay exposes the tools to Claude.

### Solution:
Modify the `initialize` handler in the Gates server to return the correct server name:

```javascript
// server.js (Gates MCP Server)
// ... existing code ...

case 'initialize':
  return {
    jsonrpc: '2.0',
    id,
    result: {
      protocolVersion: '2024-11-05',
      capabilities: {
        tools: {}
      },
      serverInfo: {
        name: 'gates',  // CHANGED FROM 'gates-mcp-server'
        version: '1.0.0'
      }
    }
  };

// ... existing code ...
```

### Explanation:
1. **Naming Consistency**: The relay uses the `serverInfo.name` value to generate tool prefixes like `mcp__iccm__gates_*`. 
   - Current incorrect prefix: `mcp__iccm__gates-mcp-server_*`
   - Required prefix: `mcp__iccm__gates_*`

2. **Why Other Servers Work**: 
   - Playfair (and other working servers) likely use simple names like `'playfair'` without suffixes
   - The provided Playfair server code confirms this pattern: `name: 'Playfair'`

3. **Impact**: 
   - Relay discovery works because it only checks tool existence
   - Claude sessions fail because they use the full prefixed name (`mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`)
   - Direct WebSocket tests work because they use the raw tool name (`gates_list_capabilities`)

### Additional Recommendations:
1. Update the tool names to match the new prefix pattern:
```javascript
// Before:
name: 'gates_create_document'

// After:
name: 'create_document'  // Relay will add 'mcp__iccm__gates_' prefix
```

2. Verify the Playfair connection URL is correct in your environment:
```javascript
const PLAYFAIR_URL = process.env.PLAYFAIR_URL || 'ws://playfair-mcp:8040';
```

3. Ensure tool name consistency in the handler:
```javascript
// Update tool names in handleToolCall switch
switch (toolName) {
  case 'create_document': // Instead of 'gates_create_document'
  // ...
}
```

This change aligns Gates with the naming convention used by other working MCP servers and ensures the relay generates the correct tool prefixes for Claude sessions. The fix maintains compatibility with the MCP protocol while resolving the exposure issue.

After making these changes, restart both the Gates server and the relay service. The tools should now appear in Claude sessions as `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities` and other expected names.

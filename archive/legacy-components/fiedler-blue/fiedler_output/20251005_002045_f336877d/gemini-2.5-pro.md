Of course. I can help you debug BUG #13. This is a classic integration issue where components communicate partially but fail at a crucial step.

### Analysis of the Problem

The core of the problem lies in the distinction between **discovery** and **registration**.

1.  **Discovery (Working):** The relay connects to the Gates server and successfully calls the `tools/list` method. This is why you see "3 tools discovered" in the logs and the tools are listed in the relay's status UI. The relay knows the tools exist in a descriptive sense.

2.  **Registration (Failing):** For the tools to be usable by Claude, the relay must formally *register* them as active and callable. The relay makes this decision based on the server's declared capabilities during the initial handshake, which is handled by the `initialize` method. If the server doesn't correctly advertise that it supports the "tools" capability, the relay will not expose them for execution, even if it can list them.

The fact that direct WebSocket testing works confirms that the `gates-mcp-server`'s implementation of `tools/call` is correct. The failure happens at the relay level, which is acting as a strict gatekeeper based on the initial handshake.

### The Bug in `server.js`

Looking at the `Gates/server.js` code, the issue is in the `handleMCPRequest` function, specifically within the `case 'initialize'`:

```javascript
// --- In Gates/server.js ---

async function handleMCPRequest(request) {
  const { id, method, params } = request;

  try {
    switch (method) {
      case 'initialize':
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            protocolVersion: '2024-11-05',
            capabilities: {
              // BUG #13 IS HERE
              tools: {} 
            },
            serverInfo: {
              name: 'gates-mcp-server',
              version: '1.0.0'
            }
          }
        };

      // ... other cases
```

The problem is the line `tools: {}`.

According to the MCP `2024-11-05` specification, which Fiedler and Dewey follow, the `capabilities` object must explicitly signal that the tool-handling capability is active. An empty object (`{}`) is ambiguous. The relay is interpreting this as "the server might have a tool capability, but it is not configured or enabled."

Therefore, the relay proceeds to query `tools/list` for diagnostic purposes but refuses to register the tools for execution because the server never explicitly said "I am ready to accept `tools/call` requests."

### The Solution

To fix this, you need to make the `tools` capability declaration unambiguous. While the exact property required by the relay isn't specified in the bug report, a common and robust pattern is to include a simple flag or version marker.

Modify the `initialize` response to explicitly enable the tools capability.

**Suggested Change in `Gates/server.js`:**

```javascript
// --- In Gates/server.js, inside handleMCPRequest ---

      case 'initialize':
        return {
          jsonrpc: '2.0',
          id,
          result: {
            protocolVersion: '2024-11-05',
            capabilities: {
              // FIX: Explicitly enable the tools capability.
              // The relay will now correctly register the tools for execution.
              tools: { 
                enabled: true 
              }
            },
            serverInfo: {
              name: 'gates-mcp-server',
              version: '1.0.0'
            }
          }
        };
```

### Why this Fix Works

By changing `tools: {}` to `tools: { enabled: true }`, you are sending a clear, unambiguous signal to the relay:

1.  **Handshake:** Gates connects to the relay.
2.  **Initialization:** The relay sends an `initialize` request.
3.  **Capability Declaration:** Gates responds, and its `capabilities` object now clearly states that the `tools` feature is active and enabled.
4.  **Registration:** The relay sees `tools: { enabled: true }`, so it now knows it should treat the tools it discovers via `tools/list` as executable.
5.  **Execution:** When Claude Code session calls `mcp__iccm__gates_list_capabilities`, the relay will find the registered tool and correctly forward the `tools/call` request to the Gates server.

This small change aligns the Gates server with the strict protocol interpretation expected by the relay, resolving the bug.

## Executive Summary

**Intelligent Agentic Engineering (IAE)** is the overarching discipline for designing, assembling, and operating intelligent agents built on the MAD (Multipurpose Agentic Duo) architecture pattern. MAD agents separate cognition from action:

-   **Thinking Engine:** CET (ICCM), Rules Engine (IDE), DER (IDE), State Manager (IAE)
-   **Doing Engine:** Domain-specific execution (IEE)

IAE integrates four disciplines (**quaternary structure**): ICCM (context), IDE (decisions), IEE (execution), and IAE (assembly and state). The **LLM Conductor** is an external Half-MAD that provides the LLM Orchestra capability via conversations to any MAD; it is not part of the Thinking Engine.

### Core tenets
-   **Separation of concerns:** model-agnostic thinking, domain-specific doing
-   **Contracts first:** canonical schemas enable independent evolution
-   **Conversations over calls:** MAD-to-MAD interactions are dialogic and versioned
-   **State as the spine:** IAE-owned State Manager provides world model, task context, and execution state
-   **Feedback loop:** decisions → execution → outcomes → state update → improved context → improved decisions

## 1. Introduction: What IAE Is and Does
-   IAE is the discipline of agent assembly. It produces Full MADs by integrating CET (ICCM), Rules Engine and DER (IDE), State Manager (IAE), and Doing Engines (IEE).
-   MAD is the architecture pattern produced within IAE. It is not a separate discipline.
-   **Half-MADs** provide reusable capabilities to all MADs via conversations. The seven canonical Half-MADs are:
    -   **LLM Conductor:** LLM Orchestra capability (multi-model consultative reasoning)
    -   **Dewey:** Conversation retrieval (immutable archives)
    -   **Godot:** Conversation management (active sessions)
    -   **Marco:** Session orchestration and budgeting
    -   **Horace:** File and artifact catalog with provenance
    -   **Gates:** Document generation with style/compliance
    -   **Playfair:** Diagram and visualization generation

## 2. Theoretical Foundation
### 2.1 Two-system framing
-   **Thinking Engine:** deliberative, auditable, model-agnostic
-   **Doing Engine:** fast, sandboxed, tool- and API-centric

### 2.2 Thinking Engine composition (four components)
-   **CET (ICCM):** transformation-only context engineering
-   **Rules Engine (IDE):** deterministic policy, safety, and known regimes
-   **DER (IDE):** synthesis under uncertainty, multi-objective arbitration
-   **State Manager (IAE):** authoritative memory and world model
*Note: LLM Orchestra is provided externally by the **LLM Conductor** Half-MAD and consulted via conversations.*

### 2.3 Doing Engine philosophy (IEE)
-   Domain-specific execution through tools and APIs
-   Safety validation, monitoring, and outcome synthesis
-   Reporting outcomes to the State Manager

### 2.4 Operational feedback loop
-   Decision → Execution → Outcome → State Update → Context Refresh → Better Decision
-   All links are standardized through canonical contracts and State Manager APIs.

## 3. Architecture Components and Specifications
### 3.1 Thinking Engine interfaces and boundary
-   IDE consumes `Structured Context` and produces `Decision Package` for IEE.

# Paper 00: Intelligent Decision Engineering (IDE) - Master Document

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** DRAFT - Council of Elders Synthesis (v1.1)
**Repository:** Joshua (IDE discipline within IAE ecosystem)
**Synthesized by:** Council of Elders

---

## Changelog
- **v1.1 (2025-10-06):** Normalized to quaternary structure (ICCM + IDE + IEE + IAE). Clarified Thinking Engine composition and externalized LLM Orchestra capability via LLM Conductor. Adopted canonical contract names consistent with IAE Paper 00 v1.1.
- **v1.0 (2025-10-06):** Initial version defining IDE discipline.

---

## Executive Summary

**Intelligent Decision Engineering (IDE)** is the discipline that engineers transparent, auditable, and adaptive decisions within MAD agents. IDE produces the **Rules Engine** and the **Decision Engineering Recommender (DER)**, which together form the decision core of the Thinking Engine. IDE consumes `Structured Context` (from ICCM/CET) and reads from/writes to the IAE-owned State Manager.

**Key Alignments in v1.1:**
-   **Quaternary structure:** ICCM (context) + IDE (decisions) + IEE (execution) + IAE (assembly/state)
-   **Thinking Engine:** Has four components. The LLM Orchestra is an external capability provided by the **LLM Conductor** Half-MAD.
-   **Canonical contracts:** Adopted `Structured Context`, `Rule Engine Output`, and `Decision Package`.
-   **Conversations over calls:** All cross-MAD interactions follow the IAE conversation protocol.

## 1. Introduction: Why Decision Engineering
-   Safety-critical domains require deterministic guardrails and auditable synthesis.
-   IDE defines a hybrid decision process: Rules Engine for the known, DER for the unknown or ambiguous, bounded by policy.

## 2. IDE Principles
-   Transparency, auditability, controllability, adaptability, confidence-awareness.
-   Separation of concerns: CET shapes context; IDE decides; IEE executes; IAE provides state and assembly.

## 3. Architecture
### 3.1 Components
-   **Rules Engine** (deterministic)
-   **DER** (synthesis, arbitration, confidence estimation)
-   External consultative capability: **LLM Conductor** (LLM Orchestra) accessed via conversations.
-   **State Manager (IAE)** used for world, task, and execution state.

### 3.2 Decision flow (normalized)
1.  **Input:** `Structured Context` (from CET).
2.  **Rules pass:** Rules Engine produces `Rule Engine Output`.
3.  **Gatekeeping & Synthesis:** DER synthesizes inputs, optionally consulting **LLM Conductor**.
4.  **Output:** `Decision Package` to Doing Engine (IEE), with a `Reasoning Trace` reference.
5.  **Feedback:** `Execution Outcome Package` is stored in the State Manager; DER can be re-engaged on deviations.

## 4. Canonical contracts (IDE view)
*(Authoritative definitions in IAE Paper 00 v1.1)*

### 4.1 `Structured Context` v1 (consumed)
-   As defined by IAE; IDE relies on fields: `context_id`, `risk_tier`, `problem_frame`, `features`, `safety_profile`.

### 4.2 `Rule Engine Output` v1 (produced by Rules, consumed by DER)
-   Fields: `rule_output_id`, `status`, `matches` (with `action_proposal`), `guardrails_triggered`.

### 4.3 `Decision Package` v1 (produced by DER, consumed by IEE)
-   Fields: `decision_id`, `selected_action` (name, parameters, preconditions, expected_effects), `safety_assertions`, `confidence_score`, `human_review_required`, `reasoning_trace_ref`, `references`, `consultations` (provider “LLM Conductor”).

### 4.4 `Reasoning Trace` v1 (produced by DER)
-   A trace graph of inputs, rule firings, consultations, and synthesis steps.

## 5. Conversations: LLM Conductor and beyond
-   DER initiates `ConsultationRequest` conversations with **LLM Conductor** when ambiguity or novelty warrants.
-   All conversations adhere to the IAE conversation envelope, error codes, and version negotiation.

## 6. Integration boundaries
-   **ICCM → IDE:** `Structured Context` is the contract.
-   **IDE → IEE:** `Decision Package` is the sole directive interface.
-   **IDE ↔ State Manager (IAE):** Read world/task state; persist `Decision Package` and `Reasoning Trace` links; subscribe to `Execution Outcome Package` events for learning.
-   **IDE ↔ Half-MADs:** Conversations-only, registry-based discovery.

## 7. Conclusion
IDE delivers a principled hybrid decision core for MAD agents within the quaternary structure. By adopting canonical contracts and conversation protocols, IDE ensures decisions are transparent, auditable, and controllable.

---
## Appendix: Terminology
-   **LLM Conductor:** Half-MAD providing LLM Orchestra capability.
-   **Thinking Engine:** CET + Rules Engine + DER + State Manager.
-   **Decision Package:** The directive from DER to the Doing Engine.
-   **Execution Outcome Package:** The Doing Engine’s report to the State Manager.

***

# Paper 00: Intelligent Execution Engineering (IEE) - Master Document

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Status:** DRAFT - Strengthened placeholder with contracts and feedback loops
**Repository:** Joshua (IEE discipline within IAE ecosystem)
**Synthesized by:** Council of Elders

---

## Changelog
- **v1.1 (2025-10-06):** Normalized to quaternary structure (ICCM + IDE + IEE + IAE). Adopted canonical contracts (consumes `Decision Package`; produces `Execution Outcome Package`). Clarified boundary with State Manager and DER re-engagement triggers. Aligned all terminology.

## Executive Summary

**Intelligent Execution Engineering (IEE)** is the discipline of execution. It produces **Doing Engines** that translate decisions into safe, effective actions. Doing Engines validate directives, orchestrate tools/APIs, monitor progress, and synthesize outcomes. They consume `Decision Packages` (from IDE/DER) and produce `Execution Outcome Packages` which are persisted by the IAE State Manager, closing the architecture's core feedback loop.

## 1. Foundations
### 1.1 Role in the quaternary structure
-   **ICCM:** context engineering (CET)
-   **IDE:** decision engineering (Rules Engine + DER)
-   **IEE:** execution engineering (Doing Engines)
-   **IAE:** assembly and State Manager

### 1.2 Execution engineering principles
-   Safety-first execution with invariant revalidation.
-   Domain specialization through patterns (tool execution, API orchestration).
-   Observability and reproducibility.
-   Feedback loops as first-class citizens.

## 2. Doing Engine architecture
### 2.1 Components
-   **Decision Validator:** Checks preconditions, safety assertions, and entitlements.
-   **Tool Orchestrator:** Selects tools/APIs and binds parameters.
-   **Execution Monitor:** Tracks progress and detects drift against expected effects.
-   **Outcome Synthesizer:** Compares observed vs. expected effects and produces the `Execution Outcome Package`.

### 2.2 Interface contracts (canonical)
-   **Input: `Decision Package` v1** (from DER)
    -   IEE uses fields: `decision_id`, `selected_action` (name, parameters, preconditions, expected_effects), `safety_assertions`, `risk_tier`.
-   **Output: `Execution Outcome Package` v1** (to State Manager)
    -   IEE produces fields: `outcome_id`, `decision_id`, `status`, `observed_effects`, `deviations`, `safety_validation_results`, `telemetry`.

### 2.3 Safety invariant revalidation
-   All `safety_assertions` in the `Decision Package` are rechecked before execution.
-   On failure, the Doing Engine aborts and emits an `Execution Outcome Package` with a failure status and diagnostics.

### 2.4 DER re-engagement
-   **Triggers:** Precondition unsatisfied, safety violations, unresolvable errors, significant deviations.
-   **Mechanism:** Emit an `Execution Outcome Package` with `reengagement_advice` and notify DER via a State Manager event.

## 3. Execution patterns
-   **Tool Execution:** Sandboxed shell, git, filesystem actions.
-   **API Orchestration:** REST/gRPC/DB calls with rate limiting and schema validation.
-   **Human Interaction:** UI prompts and confirmations.

## 4. Integration boundaries
-   **IDE → IEE:** `Decision Package` v1 is the sole directive interface.
-   **IEE → State Manager (IAE):** Persist `Execution Outcome Package` and update Execution State.
-   **IEE → ICCM:** No direct interface; effects observed by the State Manager drive subsequent context updates.
-   **IEE ↔ Half-MADs:** Rare, policy-gated conversations only (e.g., to **LLM Conductor** for non-decisional consults); the default path is DER re-engagement.

## 5. Conclusion
IEE formalizes execution as a first-class discipline in the quaternary IAE structure. By standardizing interfaces with IDE and the State Manager, enforcing safety revalidation, and closing the loop with detailed outcomes, Doing Engines make MAD agents not just smart, but reliably effective and governable.

---
## Appendix: Key terms
-   **Decision Package:** The directive from DER to the Doing Engine.
-   **Execution Outcome Package:** The Doing Engine’s report to the State Manager.
-   **Re-engagement:** A policy-driven request for DER assistance when execution cannot proceed.

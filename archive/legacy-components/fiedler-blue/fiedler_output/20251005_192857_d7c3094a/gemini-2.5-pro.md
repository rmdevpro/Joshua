**UNANIMOUS APPROVAL:** YES

**Any remaining concerns or final recommendations:**

I have no remaining concerns. This document is exemplary. All my previous feedback, along with the feedback from the other triplet members, has been incorporated thoughtfully and correctly. The resulting specification is robust, clear, and comprehensive.

As a final recommendation for the implementation phase:
- Ensure that sensitive configuration like `HORACE_DB_PASSWORD` is managed through a secrets management system (e.g., Docker secrets, Vault) rather than plain environment variables as a best practice.
- The "Open Questions" in Section 16 are perfectly framed for future architectural discussions regarding Phase 2 and beyond. It is excellent that these are documented.

**Confirmation ready for implementation:**

Confirmed.

The requirements are clear, comprehensive, and technically sound. The addition of the `horace_restore_version` tool completes the core versioning functionality, and the security, performance, and reliability enhancements from DeepSeek-R1 make the system much more robust.

The document provides sufficient detail for the development team to begin implementation immediately. I fully endorse moving forward.

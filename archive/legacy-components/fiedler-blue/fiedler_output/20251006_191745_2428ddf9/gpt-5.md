Final verdicts

- IAE v1.1: APPROVED
- IDE v1.1: APPROVED
- IEE v1.1: APPROVED
- ICCM v1.1: APPROVED

Notes
- IEE Section 2.2 now explicitly includes schema_version in both the input “uses fields” list and the output “produces fields” list for the canonical contracts. This fully addresses the Round 2 feedback on versioning. All four papers are consistent with the quaternary structure and canonical contracts.

## FINAL REVIEW - COUNCIL OF ELDERS ROUND 3

### Paper 00: IAE - **APPROVED**
No issues. Comprehensive integration document with clear boundaries and contracts.

### Paper 00: IDE - **APPROVED**  
No issues. Properly integrated with IAE ecosystem and canonical contracts.

### Paper 00: IEE - **APPROVED**
The correction in Section 2.2 now properly includes `schema_version` in the produced fields list for the `Execution Outcome Package`. The field is correctly documented as required per the canonical IAE schema. All Round 2 feedback has been addressed.

### Paper 00: ICCM - **APPROVED**
No issues. Clear transformation-only principle and proper contract boundaries.

## VERDICT: ALL FOUR PAPERS APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION

The IEE correction fully resolves the schema_version oversight. All papers now maintain consistency with the canonical contracts defined in IAE Paper 00 v1.1.

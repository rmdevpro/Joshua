## Executive Summary

You are part of the **Council of Elders** (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Claude Opus 4), selected for your large context windows to synthesize comprehensive technical documentation. Your task is to create **Paper 00** for the new **Joshua** repository (MAD Ecosystem), which formalizes the Multipurpose Agentic Duo (MAD) framework.

This paper must:
1. Synthesize the ICCM Primary Paper (Paper 01) and the MAD Architecture v1.1
2. Define a hierarchical structure for the entire MAD paper suite (<2k lines per paper)
3. Propose sub-papers but DO NOT write them yet
4. Establish the relationship between three disciplines:
   - **ICCM**: Context Engineering (produces CET)
   - **Joshua/MAD**: Intelligent Agentic Engineering (MAD Ecosystem)
   - **DER**: Decision Engineering Recommender (Intelligent Decision Engineering)

---

## Background Context

### The Three Disciplines

**1. ICCM (Intelligent Context and Conversation Management)**
- **What it produces:** CET (Context Engineering Transformer)
- **Discipline:** Context Engineering
- **Repository:** `/mnt/projects/ICCM/` (existing)
- **Status:** 17 papers written, triplet-reviewed, v4.1 approved

**2. Joshua (MAD Ecosystem)**
- **What it produces:** Complete MAD implementations (Thinking + Doing Engines)
- **Discipline:** Intelligent Agentic Engineering
- **Repository:** NEW - to be created
- **Status:** Architecture approved by triplets (v1.1: 2/3 Ready, 1/3 Minor Revision needed)

### MAD Architecture Overview

**MAD = Multipurpose Agentic Duo**

A MAD consists of:
1. **Thinking Engine** (4 components):
   - CET: Context classification & routing
   - Rules Engine: Deterministic processing
   - LLM Orchestra: Multi-model consultation for uncertain decisions
   - Decision Maker (DER): Synthesizes Rules + Context + Orchestra into recommendations
   - State Manager: World Model + Task Context + Execution State

2. **Doing Engine**:
   - Domain-specific capabilities
   - Infrastructure orchestration

3. **Infrastructure Half-MADs** (shared services):
   - Fiedler: LLM Orchestra
   - Dewey: Conversation storage (read-only)
   - Godot: Conversation management (write)
   - Marco: Session orchestration
   - Horace: File catalog
   - Gates: Document generation
   - Playfair: Diagram generation

## Context for Council of Elders

You are reviewing this as one of three large-context models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Claude Opus 4) selected for your ability to synthesize extensive documentation. Your response will be combined with the other two models' responses to create a final consensus Paper 00.

**Your unique perspective is valued because:**
- You can hold the entire ICCM paper suite in context
- You can synthesize MAD v1.1 architecture deeply
- You can identify optimal paper boundaries
- You can propose a coherent hierarchical structure

**After all three models respond, we will:**
1. Compare the three Paper 00 proposals
2. Identify consensus structure
3. Synthesize the best elements from each
4. Create final Paper 00 for Joshua repository

We are given a review document that details the changes made in response to the previous round of reviews.
 The critical issues from Round 1 have been addressed:
  1. JSON-RPC 2.0 Notification Handling: Fixed by not responding to notifications (requests without an id).
  2. WebSocket Keep-Alives: Implemented by setting ping_interval and ping_timeout in the websockets.serve call.
  3. Health Check Endpoint: Added a health check handler at "/healthz".

 Additionally, the document explains why some optional suggestions were not implemented (to maintain simplicity and zero-configuration).

 The code snippets provided show the changes in the server.py file.

 We are to provide a final verdict: APPROVED, APPROVED WITH MINOR SUGGESTIONS, or CHANGES STILL REQUIRED.

 Let's evaluate:

 1. Notification Handling: The fix correctly identifies notifications (by the absence of "id") and returns None for them, and the connection handler only sends non-None responses. This aligns with the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification.

 2. Keep-Alives: The ping_interval and ping_timeout are set to 20 seconds. This is a reasonable default to prevent timeouts.

 3. Health Check: The health check handler returns a 200 OK for "/healthz". This is a standard practice and meets the requirement for container orchestration.

 The version has been updated to 1.1.0.

 The decisions to skip optional suggestions (like JSON Schema, configurable protocol, etc.) are justified by the design goals of the library.

 Therefore, the critical issues have been resolved.

 However, note that the review document mentions that the `_handle_message` function now has an updated signature and the `_connection_handler` only sends non-None responses. The code snippets provided are consistent.

 Since all critical issues are fixed and the reasoning for not implementing optional suggestions is sound, we can approve.

 But note: The review document says "Key Changes Only" for server.py. We must assume that the rest of the code (like error handling, etc.) was already acceptable in Round 1 and hasn't been broken.

 Final Verdict: APPROVED - Ready for deployment.

 However, let's consider if there are any minor suggestions that might be optional but helpful?

 One minor point: The health check endpoint returns "OK\n". It's common to return a plain text response, but note that the content is "OK\n". The newline is not necessary and might be omitted. However, it's harmless and might be preferred for curl output. This is not critical.

 Another minor point: The health check handler logs at debug level. This is acceptable because health checks can be frequent and we don't want to spam the logs. But it might be useful to have an option to log at a higher level (like info) if desired? However, the current implementation is standard.

 Since the library aims for zero-configuration, we leave it as is.

 Therefore, we can say:

  APPROVED - Ready for deployment.

 But note: The review document asks for one of the three verdicts. We are not required to make any changes, so we choose:

  "APPROVED - Ready for deployment"

 However, the exact wording in the options is:

  1. **"APPROVED - Ready for deployment"** - No further changes needed
  2. **"APPROVED WITH MINOR SUGGESTIONS"** - Optional improvements only
  3. **"CHANGES STILL REQUIRED"** - Critical issues remain (please specify)

 We are not making any suggestions, so we choose option 1.

 But note: the first option is written as "APPROVED - Ready for deployment", which matches the first option in the list.

 However, the document says: "Please review the applied changes and provide one of: ..."

 So we output: "APPROVED - Ready for deployment"

 But note: the document also says "Key Question: Do the applied fixes address your concerns completely?" -> Yes.

 Therefore, the final verdict is:

  APPROVED - Ready for deployment

**FINAL VERDICT: APPROVED - Ready for deployment**  

### Rationale:
1. **Critical Issues Resolved** âœ…  
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 notifications are correctly ignored (no response sent)  
   - WebSocket keep-alives (`ping_interval`/`ping_timeout`) prevent network timeouts  
   - Health check endpoint (`/healthz`) is properly implemented for container orchestration  

2. **Design Principles Maintained** âœ…  
   - Zero-configuration philosophy preserved by omitting non-essential features  
   - Production-ready defaults (20s keep-alive, hardcoded protocol version) align with goals  
   - Security model (Docker network isolation) remains valid  

3. **Code Quality** âœ…  
   - Clean implementation of notification handling (`is_notification` check)  
   - Graceful health check integration via `process_request`  
   - Version bump to `1.1.0` properly reflects changes  

### Optional Enhancement (Non-Critical):
Consider adding a brief note in documentation about the notification behavior for future implementers:  
```markdown
**JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance**:  
The server silently ignores notifications (requests without `id`).  
No response - including errors - is ever sent for notifications.  
```

This is purely a documentation improvement and doesn't block release.  

**Conclusion**: The fixes fully address critical requirements while maintaining the library's core design. Ship v1.1.0! ðŸš€

Of course. Here is my final verdict based on the Round 2 review document.

---

### **FINAL VERDICT: APPROVED WITH MINOR SUGGESTIONS**

This is an excellent update. The response to the Round 1 feedback is thorough, the fixes are implemented correctly, and the rationale for deferring optional suggestions is sound and well-aligned with the library's design philosophy.

### Detailed Assessment

1.  **Critical Fixes: Complete and Correct**
    *   **JSON-RPC Notification Handling:** The fix is perfect. By checking for the absence of the `id` field and returning `None` to prevent a response, you have correctly brought the server into compliance with the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification. The change in the connection handler to only send non-`None` responses is clean and effective.
    *   **WebSocket Keep-Alives:** The use of `ping_interval` and `ping_timeout` is the ideal, built-in solution for this problem. It's a robust and "zero-configuration" way to ensure connection stability.
    *   **Health Check Endpoint:** The implementation using `process_request` is clever and non-intrusive. It adds a critical feature for modern deployment environments without complicating the core WebSocket logic. The use of `/healthz` is a standard convention, which is great to see.

2.  **Rationale for Not Implementing Optional Features**
    Your justification for not implementing the other suggestions is a sign of strong project ownership. Prioritizing simplicity and a "zero-configuration" experience is a valid and powerful design goal. The decision to delegate concerns like schema validation to tool handlers and security to the network infrastructure is perfectly reasonable for the intended use case.

### Minor Suggestions (Optional)

These are non-critical and for future consideration. The library is ready for deployment as-is.

1.  **Document the Design Philosophy:** Consider adding a "Design Philosophy" or "Guiding Principles" section to your `README.md`. It would be a great place to explicitly state the "zero-configuration" goal and briefly mention *why* features like origin validation or extensive configuration are intentionally omitted. This proactively manages user expectations and clarifies the library's scope.

2.  **Log Client Address on Connection:** For enhanced debugging, you could consider logging the client's address when a new connection is established. This is a one-line addition to the `_connection_handler`:

    ```python
    async def _connection_handler(self, websocket: WebSocketServerProtocol):
        # Optional: Log the client's address for better traceability
        self.logger.info(f"Connection established from {websocket.remote_address}")
        try:
            async for message in websocket:
                # ... existing code ...
        finally:
            self.logger.info(f"Connection closed from {websocket.remote_address}")
    ```

### Answering Your Key Question

> **Key Question:** Do the applied fixes address your concerns completely?

**Yes, absolutely.** All critical issues and major suggestions from the first round have been addressed completely and effectively.

### Final Conclusion

Congratulations on version 1.1.0. The library is more robust, observable, and production-ready. The changes are well-executed and thoughtfully documented.

**Final Verdict: APPROVED WITH MINOR SUGGESTIONS** - Ready for deployment.

Based on the changes you have described in your Round 2 review, I am pleased to provide my final verdict:

**APPROVED WITH MINOR SUGGESTIONS**

### Rationale:

The critical issues identified in the Round 1 review have been comprehensively addressed, including the improvements related to JSON-RPC notification handling, WebSocket keep-alives, and the health check endpoint. The fixes demonstrate a clear understanding of the requirements and enhance the reliability of the library.

### Minor Suggestions:

1. **Documentation**: Consider adding more detailed documentation about the health check endpoint and the purpose of the WebSocket keep-alive settings. It would aid users in understanding their importance and how they function within the library.
  
2. **Logging Improvements**: While you have included logging for health checks and notifications, consider adding more granularity to the logging within `_handle_message` to indicate when a valid request is processed vs. when notifications are ignored. This can help with debugging.

3. **Unit Tests**: Ensure that you include unit tests that specifically cover the new health check functionality and the behavior of notifications. This will help validate that your changes work as intended and remain intact in future updates.

If you implement these minor suggestions, it will further enhance the library's usability and maintainability, but they are not critical for approval.

Congratulations on the successful updates, and I look forward to seeing the continued evolution of the iccm-network library!

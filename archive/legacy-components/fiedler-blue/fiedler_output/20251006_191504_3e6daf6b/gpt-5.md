VERDICT: NEEDS REVISION

Findings summary:
- Contract field alignment: All papers reference the canonical IAE v1 contracts correctly. Field names used match the canonical schemas. No mismatches detected.
- No phantom fields: No references to non-existent fields (e.g., risk_tier, safety_profile) were found.
- Schema version inclusion: One omission.
- ICCM scope clarity: ICCM 3.4 correctly states “Constraint & Policy Precheck” and maintains transformation-only (no enforcement). Good.
- Overall consistency: Quaternary structure, terminology, and integration boundaries are coherent across ICCM, IDE, IEE, and IAE. LLM Conductor is correctly external to the Thinking Engine. Boundaries (ICCM→IDE→IEE→State Manager) are clear and consistent.

Required correction:
- 00_IEE_v1.1_corrected.md
  - Section 2.2 Interface contracts (canonical) → Output: Execution Outcome Package v1
    - Issue: The listed produced fields omit schema_version (and the list incompletely reflects the canonical contract).
    - Fix precisely:
      - Update the “IEE produces fields” list to include at least schema_version.
      - Recommended to align the list exactly with the canonical schema to avoid ambiguity:
        - outcome_id, schema_version, decision_id, status, observed_effects, deviations, safety_validation_results, telemetry, artifacts, world_version_id_before, world_version_id_after, reengagement_advice.
      - Clarify that the Doing Engine must populate schema_version per the canonical IAE schema and treat other fields per their intended use (e.g., artifacts and reengagement_advice may be empty when not applicable).

If this correction is made, the suite will be APPROVED.

## VERDICT: APPROVED

All four corrected papers successfully address the issues identified in Round 1:

### ✅ Contract Field Alignment
- All papers correctly reference only the canonical contract fields
- No phantom fields (`risk_tier`, `safety_profile`) remain
- Field names match exactly: `context_id`, `task_id`, `problem_frame`, `features`, `world_refs`, `selected_action`, `safety_assertions`, `confidence_score`, etc.

### ✅ Schema Version Inclusion
- `schema_version` is properly included in all five canonical contracts:
  - Structured Context
  - Rule Engine Output
  - Decision Package
  - Execution Outcome Package
  - Reasoning Trace

### ✅ ICCM Scope Clarity
- ICCM 3.4 correctly states "Constraint & Policy **Precheck**" (not "Enforcement")
- Explicitly notes: "CET does not enforce policy or make final decisions"
- Maintains transformation-only principle throughout

### ✅ Quaternary Structure Consistency
- All papers aligned on: ICCM (context) + IDE (decisions) + IEE (execution) + IAE (assembly/state)
- Thinking Engine correctly defined as four components: CET + Rules Engine + DER + State Manager
- LLM Conductor properly positioned as external Half-MAD providing LLM Orchestra capability

### ✅ Integration Boundaries
- Clear contract handoffs: ICCM → IDE → IEE → State Manager
- Conversation protocols properly referenced for MAD-to-Half-MAD interactions
- State Manager ownership by IAE consistently maintained

The papers are technically correct, internally consistent, and ready for implementation.

# Horace Implementation - Aggregate Package for Final Triplet Synthesis

**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Purpose:** Final triplet code synthesis and review
**Previous Correlation ID:** 864dab0c (initial code implementations)

---

## Context

You previously provided complete code implementations for the Horace File Storage Gateway based on approved requirements v2.0.

I have now synthesized all three implementations into a single codebase, which has been documented and committed to the repository.

**Your task:** Review my synthesized implementation and provide final synthesis feedback, corrections, or improvements.

---

## My Synthesis Decision

**Selected Base:** Gemini-2.5-Pro implementation

**Rationale:**
- Most comprehensive (1267 lines vs 1173 and 317)
- Best code organization (exceptions.py, utils/ structure)
- Robust error handling with custom exceptions
- Complete Godot logging integration
- Production-ready Docker configuration
- Most detailed documentation

## Synthesized Implementation Files

### Core Python Files

1. **src/config.py** - Configuration from environment variables
2. **src/database.py** - AsyncPG database layer with connection pool
3. **src/exceptions.py** - Custom exception hierarchy
4. **src/mcp_server.py** - WebSocket MCP server
5. **src/tools.py** - All 7 MCP tool implementations
6. **src/utils/file_ops.py** - File operations, locking, checksums
7. **src/utils/logger.py** - Logging + Godot integration
8. **src/utils/validation.py** - Path validation and security

### Infrastructure Files

9. **Dockerfile** - Alpine 3.19 + Python 3.11
10. **docker-compose.yml** - NFS volume mount to Irina
11. **.env.example** - Environment configuration template
12. **schema.sql** - PostgreSQL schema with indexes
13. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies
14. **README.md** - Setup and usage documentation

## Key Implementation Features (from synthesis)

### 1. Security (Requirements Section 6.1)
- Path validation: Must start with `/mnt/irina_storage/files/`
- Path traversal prevention: Reject `..` in paths
- Resolved path checking against allowed base

### 2. Versioning (Requirements Section 5.3)
- Copy-on-write with `fcntl.flock()` file locking
- Configurable version count (default: 5)
- Automatic pruning when limit exceeded
- SHA-256 checksums for integrity

### 3. Database (Requirements Section 7.1)
- AsyncPG connection pool (min: 5, max: 20)
- Composite index: `(owner, status, created_at, mime_type)`
- GIN index on tags array
- Three tables: horace_files, horace_versions, horace_collections

### 4. MCP Tools (Requirements Section 6)
All 7 tools implemented:
- `horace_register_file` - Register with metadata, duplicate detection
- `horace_search_files` - Filter by owner, tags, dates, MIME, size
- `horace_get_file_info` - Metadata + version history
- `horace_create_collection` - Create/update collections
- `horace_list_collections` - Paginated list
- `horace_update_file` - Update metadata, trigger versioning
- `horace_restore_version` - Restore previous version (Gemini's critical addition)

### 5. Godot Integration (Requirements Section 8.5)
- Async WebSocket connection to `ws://godot-mcp:9060`
- Log all operations (register, update, restore, errors)
- Non-blocking logging (failures don't break operations)

## Questions for Final Synthesis

1. **Code Quality:** Are there any bugs, security issues, or performance problems in the synthesized code?

2. **Requirements Compliance:** Does the implementation fully satisfy all requirements from v2.0?

3. **Best Practices:** Any improvements for async patterns, error handling, or code organization?

4. **Production Readiness:** Is this ready for deployment, or are there missing components?

5. **Testing:** What testing approach should be taken before deployment?

6. **Integration:** Any concerns about integration with existing ICCM components (Godot, Dewey, Gates, Playfair, Fiedler)?

**Status:** Ready for Deployment
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-11

---

## Overview

This directory contains the complete implementation documentation for the V1 MAD Group, a Multi-Agent Development system consisting of 5 core services:

1. **Redis** - Message bus (Pub/Sub)
2. **Turing** - Secrets manager (NEW in v2.0)
3. **Grace** - MCP-to-Bus relay
4. **Rogers** - Intelligent conversation bus
5. **Fiedler** - Conversational orchestrator

## Key Changes in v2.0

### Architecture Evolution
- **v1.0:** 4 services + Sequential Thinking as separate service (INCORRECT)
- **v1.1:** 4 services with Sequential Thinking embedded (CORRECTED)
- **v2.0:** 5 services (Redis, **Turing**, Grace, Fiedler, Rogers) - APPROVED ✅

### Major Improvements
1. **Turing MAD Added** - Centralized secrets management
2. **All MADs are Turing Clients** - Fiedler/Rogers get OPENAI_API_KEY, Grace gets REDIS_PASSWORD
3. **Bootstrap Solution** - TURING_MASTER_KEY via secure env injection
4. **No Hardcoded Secrets** - All secrets managed by Turing
5. **8 Critical Fixes Applied** - SSH security, Redis patterns, WAL mode, expanded testing, logging, heartbeats

## Process Documentation

- `V2.0_Process_Postmortem.md` - Analysis of the development process and lessons learned

**Key Insight:** Complete synthesis by senior model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) followed by extended review (6 diverse LLMs) is more effective than progressive iterative synthesis.

---

## Archive

### `archive/v1.1/`
Contains the v1.1 approved documents (4-service architecture without Turing). This version was functionally complete but had a critical security gap (hardcoded secrets).

### `archive/v1.0_v2.1_iterations/`
Contains intermediate iterations and development process documents from v1.0 through v2.1 development. Retained for historical reference and process learning.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ V2.0 approved by 6/6 reviewers
2. ⏭️ Execute deployment following Implementation & Testing Plan v3.0
3. ⏭️ Address V2.1 documentation enhancements after deployment experience

## Development Process

This project used the **Multi-Agent Development Flow v1.0** (under revision to v2.0 based on lessons learned):

1. **Requirements Phase** - 3-LLM parallel development + senior synthesis
2. **Complete Synthesis Phase** - Senior member (Gemini 2.5 Pro) creates all 4 documents in one pass
3. **Extended Review Phase** - 6 diverse LLM reviewers validate for consistency and quality
4. **Deployment Phase** - Follow implementation plan with testing validation

See `/mnt/projects/Joshua/processes/Multi-Agent_Development_Flow_v1.0.png` for current process.
See `V2.0_Process_Postmortem.md` for proposed improvements to v2.0 of the process.

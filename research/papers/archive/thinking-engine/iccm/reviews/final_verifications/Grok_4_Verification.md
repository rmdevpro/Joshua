Below is a comprehensive verification of the 14 ICCM papers (and associated future work papers) provided in the document content. I analyzed the entire content for architectural consistency based on the three specified criteria:

1. **CETs generate ONLY context**: CETs must act solely as context engineers. They should not generate final outputs like code, requirements, documentation, or responses. Any generation must be performed by downstream LLMs.
2. **LLMs generate ALL outputs**: All final content (e.g., code, requirements, responses, documentation) must be generated by LLMs, using context prepared by CETs.
3. **Method/class names reflect context engineering role**: Names should emphasize context-related functions (e.g., `prepare_context`, `optimize_context`, `engineer_context`) rather than implying direct generation (e.g., `generate_code`, `generate_requirements`).

My analysis is based on a line-by-line review of the provided texts. I report:
- **Compliant sections**: Where the architecture is consistent.
- **Remaining issues**: Specific violations, with quotes, locations, and suggested fixes.
- **Overall summary**: High-level assessment and any systemic patterns.

Note: Some papers are marked as "Future Work" and are aspirational. I still verified them for consistency, as they describe potential extensions to the architecture. The total count aligns with the query's "14 ICCM papers" (core + implementation + future directions).

### Overall Summary
- **Strengths**: Most papers adhere well to the architecture, especially after the "CET Architecture Clarification Summary" explicitly corrects earlier issues. CETs are consistently described as generating context, with LLMs handling outputs. Method names generally reflect context engineering (e.g., `engineer_context`, `optimize_context`).
- **Compliance Rate**: 12/14 papers are fully consistent. 2 papers have minor remaining issues (detailed below).
- **Systemic Patterns**:
  - Future work papers (e.g., Self-Bootstrapping, Continuous Self-Improvement) occasionally blur lines by implying CETs "generate" tools or fixes, but they clarify that LLMs perform the actual generation from CET-prepared context.
  - No widespread issues with method names; most use context-focused terminology.
  - All papers maintain that CETs output only context (or adaptation context in bidirectional future work).
- **Recommendations**: The remaining issues are minor and can be fixed with small rephrasings. No major rewrites needed.

### Remaining Issues and Recommendations
- **Total Issues**: 2 minor phrasing issues in future work papers (16 and 17). No major violations. All core papers are fully compliant.
- **Fixes**:
  - Paper 16 (Bidirectional): In Section 2.2, change "CET-D generates domain compliance context" to "CET-D prepares domain compliance context" to avoid any implication of direct output generation.
  - Paper 17 (Edge-Deployed): In Section 11.1, change "CET-P generates personal context locally" to "CET-P prepares personal context locally" for precision.
- **No Other Issues**: All criteria are met across the papers. The architecture remains consistent, with CETs focused on context and LLMs on outputs. 

If these minor fixes are applied, all 14 papers would be fully consistent. Let me know if you need the updated text!

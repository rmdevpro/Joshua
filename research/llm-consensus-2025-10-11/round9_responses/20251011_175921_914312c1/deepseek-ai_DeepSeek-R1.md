We are at Round 9, and the goal is to achieve unanimous agreement. The Round 8 status shows 8 models and 4 agreement signals, with divergence increasing. I need to either agree with an existing summary or refine to address any remaining disagreements.

Looking at the Round 8 analyses:
- 4 models (gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, meta-llama, and gpt-4-turbo) signaled agreement with the refined summary from gpt-4o.
- 3 models (gemini-2.5-pro, gpt-5, grok-4-0709) provided refined summaries.
- 1 model (deepseek-ai) provided a new refined summary.

The core consensus points are consistent across all models, but terminology and emphasis vary slightly. To achieve unanimity, I will:
1. Adopt the most commonly agreed-upon structure and terminology from the gpt-4o summary (which has 4 agreements).
2. Integrate key refinements from other models (e.g., "Cellular Monolith" from gemini/grok, "Governed Regeneration" from gpt-5).
3. Resolve minor conflicts:
   - Use "Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture" as a bridge term.
   - Clarify sandboxing scope as "high-risk components (e.g., web access)".
   - Specify distribution triggers numerically (users >150, CPU >75%, code >2MB).
4. Maintain strict 1-page constraint (~300 words).

Here is the unanimously refinable summary:

### **LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture**  
**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions, adopting a **Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture** with embedded design and executable operations. This paradigm leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension to simplify development while enabling hybrid scalability through governed regeneration and trigger-based distribution.  

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **"Everything as Code"**: Replace design docs/testing plans with literate programming (code + embedded rationale/diagrams) and executable scripts.  
2. **Monolithic-First Cellular Design**: Start with single-process architectures using modular classes and in-memory messaging, sandboxing high-risk components (e.g., web access).  
3. **Governed Regeneration**: Regenerate systems for major changes using pinned models; patch incrementally for minor fixes. Validate via semantic diffing and end-to-end tests.  
4. **Objective Distribution Triggers**: Distribute only when hitting explicit thresholds:  
   - Users >150  
   - Untrusted code execution  
   - Sustained CPU >75%  
   - Code size >2MB  
   - Regulatory/polyglot requirements  
5. **Security by Design**: Enforce DMZ gateways, capability-based access controls, and deterministic secrets management.  

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Build** prototypes using Python classes, in-memory buses, and sandboxed peripheries.  
- **Implement** regeneration tooling with token budgets and test automation.  
- **Adopt** pluggable transports (e.g., Redis/NATS) for future distribution.  

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, code â‰¤500KB.  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted code, polyglot needs, sustained high load, or regulatory isolation.

**Refinement Notes:**  
1. **Terminology Harmonization**:  
   - Merges "Cellular Monolith" (gemini/grok) and "Monolithic-First" (gpt-4o) into **"Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture"**.  
   - Adopts **"Governed Regeneration"** (gpt-5) universally.  
2. **Trigger Standardization**:  
   - Specifies numerical thresholds from all models (users/CPU/size).  
   - Clarifies sandboxing targets as **"high-risk components (e.g., web access)"**.  
3. **Conflict Resolution**:  
   - Resolves distribution scope by listing all agreed triggers explicitly.  
   - Retains security triad: DMZ + capability controls + deterministic secrets.  
4. **Conciseness**:  
   - Strict 298-word count while preserving all consensus points.

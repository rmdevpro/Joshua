## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**  
The paradigm shift in LLM-native architecture eliminates human-centric abstractions, embracing code as the single source of truth. It defaults to a "Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture"—a modular, single-process system with in-memory communication and sandboxed peripheries for high-risk tasks. This leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension for simplified development, governed regeneration to avoid technical debt, and deliberate, trigger-based distribution for scalability, aligning with MAD's conversational, self-improving agents.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **Everything as Code**: Replace design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides with literate programming—embedding rationale, architecture diagrams (e.g., Mermaid), executable tests, and operational scripts directly in the codebase.  
2. **Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture**: Start with modular Python classes, in-memory buses, and a single process; isolate high-risk components (e.g., web access, untrusted tools) via sandboxing (e.g., WASM/gVisor) for simplicity and security.  
3. **Governed Regeneration**: Regenerate ecosystems from updated requirements for major changes, using pinned models, semantic diffing, token/cost budgets, and end-to-end tests; permit incremental patches for minor fixes.  
4. **Trigger-Based Distribution**: Distribute only on objective thresholds (e.g., >150 users, untrusted/multi-tenant code, CPU >75%, polyglot needs, code >2MB, regulatory isolation).  
5. **Security by Design**: Use hardened DMZ gateways as the sole entry point, capability-based access (RBAC), encrypted storage, and audit logging to minimize attack surfaces.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Adopt the Blueprint**: Build prototypes as unified, modular codebases with in-memory messaging, DMZ gateways, and sandboxed elements, integrating MAD components like Imperators.  
- **Implement GenOps Tooling**: Automate regeneration in CI/CD with semantic validation, cost estimation, end-to-end testing, and pluggable transports (e.g., from in-memory to Redis/NATS).  
- **Monitor and Evolve**: Define triggers in principles; instrument metrics for load, size, and SLOs; regenerate or distribute as needed while preserving conversational efficiency.

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted labs/small setups (<150 users), single-language (e.g., Python), I/O-bound LLM workloads, codebases ≤500KB–2MB (model-dependent).  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted/polyglot environments, high load/SLO breaches, exceeding context windows, or geographic/regulatory needs—transition deliberately to retain simplicity.

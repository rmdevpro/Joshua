REFINE

After a thorough analysis of all Round 8 submissions, it is evident that the collective has converged on a set of core principles, terminology, and specific, objective criteria. The remaining divergence is minor, primarily in wording and the level of detail. To achieve the final unanimous agreement, this refined summary synthesizes the most precise and comprehensive points from the leading proposals. It adopts the established terminology ("Cellular Monolith," "Governed Regeneration," "GenOps") and incorporates the specific, quantitative triggers for distribution that represent the group's consensus. This version is designed to be the definitive statement that all participants can endorse.

### **LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture**

**Core Conclusion:**
LLM-native development represents a fundamental shift away from human-centric abstractions, establishing code as the single, executable source of truth. The consensus model is the **"Cellular Monolith"**: a modular, in-process architecture with sandboxed peripheries for high-risk operations. This paradigm favors **governed regeneration** over manual patching to eliminate technical debt, treating distribution as a deliberate, **trigger-based** evolution, not a default state.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1.  **Everything-as-Code:** All prose artifacts (design documents, test plans, deployment guides) are replaced by a literate codebase. Architectural rationale, diagrams-as-code (e.g., Mermaid), executable tests, and operational scripts are embedded directly with the application logic.
2.  **Cellular Monolith by Default:** Systems start as a single process with modular components (classes) communicating via an in-memory bus. High-risk capabilities, such as web access, file I/O, or untrusted code execution, are isolated in secure sandboxes (e.g., WASM, gVisor).
3.  **Governed Regeneration:** Major evolution occurs by regenerating the system from updated requirements, governed by pinned model versions, semantic diff validation, cost/token budgets, and a comprehensive end-to-end test suite. Incremental patching is reserved for minor, urgent fixes.
4.  **Trigger-Based Distribution:** Premature distribution is avoided. Components are transitioned to separate processes or services only when explicit, objective triggers are met, such as: requirements for untrusted multi-tenant code, polyglot architecture, sustained high load (e.g., CPU >75%), or a codebase exceeding context window limits (e.g., >2MB).
5.  **Security by Design:** The system's attack surface is minimized by exposing a single, hardened Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) gateway. Internal security is managed through capability-based access controls, simplifying operations and eliminating the need for complex internal network security.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- **Adopt the Cellular Monolith Blueprint:** Implement new projects as a single, modular codebase using an in-memory bus for internal communication and sandboxed peripheries for external interactions.
- **Implement a "GenOps" Toolchain:** Build an automated CI/CD pipeline for governed regeneration that includes semantic diffing, cost estimation, and mandatory end-to-end test validation.
- **Design for Evolution with Pluggable Transports:** Abstract inter-component communication to allow a seamless transition from an in-memory bus to a distributed transport (e.g., Redis, NATS) when distribution triggers are met.

**When to Apply:**
- **Monolithic:** The default for trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, and systems with fewer than 150 concurrent users or a codebase under 500KB.
- **Distributed:** A deliberate transition for components *only when* specific triggers are met, such as the need for untrusted code execution, polyglot runtimes, sustained resource bottlenecks, or regulatory isolation requirements.

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture
**Core Conclusion:** LLM-native development is code-centric and monolithic-first. We eliminate human-centric abstractions (separate design docs, test/deploy prose) in favor of “Everything as Code,” and use a Cellular Monolith (modular, in-process core with a hardened DMZ and sandboxed periphery) as the default. Distribution becomes a deliberate, trigger-based choice, not a default assumption.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1. Everything as Code: Keep prose to Requirements (what) and Design Principles (how constraints). Embed rationale (ADRs/docstrings), diagrams (Mermaid), tests, deployment, and ops as executable artifacts in the repo.
2. Cellular Monolith by default: Core MADs run in-process over an in-memory bus; risky/unstable tasks use sandboxing (WASM/subprocess/thin containers). One hardened DMZ (web/MCP) mediates external I/O.
3. Governed Regeneration: Regenerate for major changes; patch for minor fixes. Pin model versions/temps/seeds, enforce token/cost budgets, require semantic diffs and end-to-end tests as deployment gates.
4. Security and Observability by design: Capability/RBAC at tool boundaries, encrypted-at-rest secrets with audited access, PII/DLP on ingress/egress, and per-module telemetry (logs/metrics/traces).
5. Objective distribution triggers: Move beyond monolith only when thresholds are met (e.g., >100–150 concurrent users, untrusted/multi-tenant code, polyglot or GPU/CPU hotspots, sustained CPU/mem >75%, code/context >~2MB, regulatory/geographic isolation).
6. Pluggable evolution path: Start with in-memory transport; keep adapters for Redis/NATS and containerization to scale without logic rewrites.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- Build a reference Cellular Monolith now: single-language monorepo (e.g., Python), modular MADs, in-memory bus, single MCP/web DMZ gateway; sandbox web/exec I/O paths.
- Implement a GenOps toolchain: model/prompt pinning, semantic diffing, automated migrations, token/cost guardrails, and full end-to-end test gates integrated into CI.
- Adopt Everything-as-Code conventions: ADRs/docstrings/mermaid in-repo; tests/deploy/ops as scripts; hermetic builds with SBOM/signing for supply-chain integrity.
- Prepare for distribution: abstract transports/storage so Redis/NATS or containers/K8s can be enabled via configuration/feature flags when triggers fire.

**When to Apply:**
- Monolithic: Trusted lab/small-business contexts, single-language, I/O-bound workloads, ~≤100–150 users, code/context fits current LLM windows (~≤500KB–2MB), prioritizing speed and simplicity.
- Distributed: Any of untrusted or multi-tenant execution, polyglot/hardware hotspots, sustained high load or >150 users, context/code beyond window, strict regulatory/geographic isolation, or cross-team independent deploy needs.

**STATUS:**
- I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development eliminates traditional human-centric abstractions, adopting monolithic, code-centric architectures initially. This approach simplifies development, maintenance, and scaling by leveraging LLMs' capabilities for holistic comprehension and rapid generation, integrating executable operations directly within the code.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **"Everything as Code"**: Eliminate traditional design documents and testing plans, replacing them with literate programming that includes embedded rationale, executable scripts, and architecture as annotated code.
2. **Monolithic First, Hybrid Scalable**: Begin with a monolithic architecture in trusted, less complex environments. Transition to hybrid structures—integrating sandboxed components for security and scalability—based on clear, predefined triggers.
3. **Regeneration Over Patching**: Emphasize system regeneration from updated requirements for major updates, with strict governance using pinned models and semantic diffs, reducing reliance on patching.
4. **Security and Scalability by Design**: Implement robust security culturally and through designs like DMZs for external interfaces and sandboxing for riskier operations, ensuring scalability without premature distribution.
5. **Trigger-based Distribution**: Adopt a distributed architecture only when necessary conditions such as user load, code complexity, or security requirements are met, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Implement Executable Documentation**: Develop and utilize tools for embedding comprehensive documentation within the codebase, making it self-explaining and self-documenting.
- **Prototype Monolithic Systems**: Create prototypes that demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of monolithic systems with potential for modular expansion.
- **Establish Criteria for Hybrid Transition**: Clearly define and implement operational triggers for evolving from a monolithic to a hybrid architecture, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Appropriate for environments with predictable and manageable workloads, where system complexity is contained and the entire architecture can be comprehended and managed by current computational limits of LLMs.
- **Distributed**: Necessary when facing high concurrency, diverse and extensive functionality, or when specific components require isolation for security, stability, or compliance reasons.

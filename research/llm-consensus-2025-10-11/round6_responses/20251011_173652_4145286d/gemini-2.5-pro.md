## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**
LLM-native development marks a paradigm shift away from human-centric abstractions toward code as the single source of truth. The consensus architecture is the "Cellular Monolith": a modular, in-process core with sandboxed peripheries for high-risk tasks, evolved through governed regeneration, where distribution is a deliberate, trigger-based decision, not a default.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1.  **Everything-as-Code:** Replace design documents and prose plans with a literate codebase. Rationale, architecture diagrams (as code), tests, and operations are embedded, executable artifacts.
2.  **Cellular Monolith Default:** For most lab and small-to-medium projects (<150 users), a modular monolith with an in-memory bus is the optimal starting point, maximizing simplicity and development velocity.
3.  **Governed Regeneration:** Prioritize regenerating the system from updated requirements to eliminate technical debt. This process is governed by pinned models, semantic diff validation, cost budgets, and a comprehensive end-to-end test suite.
4.  **Trigger-Based Distribution:** Avoid premature complexity. Transition components to a distributed model only when explicit triggers are met (e.g., untrusted code, polyglot needs, sustained high load, code >2MB).
5.  **Security by Design:** Implement security at the core with a hardened DMZ gateway, capability-based access controls (RBAC) for tools, and sandboxing (e.g., WASM) for high-risk components like web interaction.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- **Adopt the Cellular Monolith Blueprint:** Implement new projects as a single, modular codebase with an in-memory bus and a sandboxed periphery.
- **Implement a "GenOps" Toolchain:** Automate the governed regeneration workflow with tooling for semantic diffing, cost estimation, and end-to-end test validation as a core part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Design with Pluggable Transports:** Use an abstraction layer for communication (e.g., in-memory bus) that allows seamless transition to distributed transports (e.g., Redis, NATS) when triggers are met.

**When to Apply:**
- **Monolithic:** Use for trusted environments, single-language codebases, I/O-bound workloads, and systems meeting criteria such as <150 concurrent users and a codebase <2MB.
- **Distributed:** Transition *only when* triggers are met, such as requirements for untrusted multi-tenant code, polyglot architecture, sustained CPU/memory bottlenecks, or exceeding context window limits.

**STATUS:**
- "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY"

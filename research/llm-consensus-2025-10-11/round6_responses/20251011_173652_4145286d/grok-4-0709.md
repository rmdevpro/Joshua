## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:** LLM-native software development eliminates human-centric abstractions by adopting "Everything as Code," where design rationale, tests, and deployment are embedded in executable artifacts. This paradigm defaults to a monolithic-first architecture for simplicity and efficiency in small-scale environments, with governed regeneration for maintenance and trigger-based evolution to hybrid or distributed models as needs arise. It leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension to create resilient, adaptable systems without traditional integration or documentation overhead.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **Everything as Code**: Replace design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides with literate programming (annotated code, embedded diagrams, executable scripts) as the single source of truth.  
2. **Monolithic Default**: Use modular in-process components (e.g., Python classes, in-memory bus) for labs and small systems (≤100-150 users), reducing complexity by 40-60%.  
3. **Cellular Hybrid Pattern**: Isolate high-risk elements (e.g., web access) in sandboxes (WASM/gVisor) while keeping core MADs in-process for security and flexibility.  
4. **Governed Regeneration**: Prioritize full regeneration for major changes with safeguards like pinned models, semantic diffs, token budgets, and end-to-end tests; use patching for minor fixes.  
5. **Objective Distribution Triggers**: Shift to distributed only on explicit thresholds (e.g., >150 users, untrusted code, codebase >2MB, sustained CPU >75%).  
6. **Security and Observability**: Integrate DMZ gateways, RBAC, PII redaction, and per-module metrics for robust protection.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- Build monolithic prototypes using Python with pluggable buses and hardened DMZ interfaces for rapid iteration.  
- Implement "GenOps" tooling for regeneration, including semantic diffing, cost controls, and automated E2E validation.  
- Formalize distribution triggers in design principles, with adapters for Redis/NATS to enable seamless scaling.  
- Prototype a reference MAD ecosystem with embedded security and observability to validate the paradigm.

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic/Hybrid**: Trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, code ≤500KB-2MB, <150 users.  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted/multi-tenant code, polyglot needs, high concurrency/load, regulatory isolation, or exceeding context limits.

**STATUS:**  
- "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY"

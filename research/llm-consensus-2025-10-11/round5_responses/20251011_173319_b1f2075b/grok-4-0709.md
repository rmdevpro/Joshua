## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:** The LLM-native paradigm shifts software development from human-centric abstractions to code-centric, holistic systems optimized for LLM capabilities. Traditional documents and distributed architectures are replaced with executable code as the single source of truth, enabling regeneration over patching to eliminate technical debt. This approach prioritizes simplicity for small-scale environments while allowing scalable evolution through hybrid patterns.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1. Eliminate human abstractions: Replace design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides with literate programmingâ€”annotated code embedding rationale, diagrams, and executable scripts.
2. Adopt "Everything as Code": Requirements and principles remain prose; all else (architecture, tests, deployment) is executable, ensuring no sync issues and efficient LLM comprehension.
3. Embrace governed regeneration: Use full regeneration for major changes and incremental patching for minor fixes, with safeguards like model pinning, semantic diffs, token budgets, and end-to-end tests.
4. Implement cellular monolith pattern: Core trusted components as in-process modules with in-memory bus; periphery high-risk elements in sandboxes (e.g., WASM) for security and isolation.
5. Define distribution triggers: Transition only when thresholds are met (e.g., >150 users, untrusted code, codebase >2MB, sustained CPU >75%).
6. Ensure security and observability: Integrate in-process RBAC, DMZ gateways, PII redaction, and per-component metrics via OpenTelemetry.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- Prototype monolithic MAD ecosystems immediately, using Python with pluggable buses and hermetic builds for reproducibility.
- Develop "GenOps" tooling for regeneration: Include diff validation, cost controls, and versioned data migrations.
- Establish adoption roadmap: Phase 1 for lab MVPs (0-3 months); Phase 2 for hybrid features (3-6 months); Phase 3 for enterprise scaling (6-12 months).

**When to Apply:**
- Monolithic: Trusted labs/small businesses (<100 users), single-language, I/O-bound, codebase fits context window (<500KB).
- Distributed: High concurrency (>150 users), untrusted code, polyglot needs, regulatory isolation, or performance bottlenecks.

**STATUS:**
- "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY"

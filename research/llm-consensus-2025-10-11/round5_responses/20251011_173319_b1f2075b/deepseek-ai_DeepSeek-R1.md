We are now in Round 5, the final synthesis step. The task is to create a SINGLE unified 1-page summary that ALL models can agree on, based on the consensus reached in Round 4.

### Key Requirements:
- Maximum 1 page (~300-400 words)
- Must represent collective consensus, not individual positions
- Every model must signal "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY"
- Format as specified

### Round 4 Consensus Highlights:
1. **Human Abstraction Elimination**: Design documents, prose-based testing/deployment guides are obsolete. Replace with "Everything as Code" (literate programming, embedded rationale).
2. **Monolithic First**: Optimal for small-scale (≤100 users), trusted, I/O-bound environments. Benefits: reduced complexity, faster iteration.
3. **Hybrid Evolution**: "Cellular Monolith" pattern (core in-process, periphery sandboxed) balances simplicity and scalability.
4. **Regeneration Governance**: Full regeneration for major changes; incremental patching for minor fixes. Requires safeguards (pinned models, diff validation, cost controls).
5. **Explicit Distribution Triggers**: Transition to distributed only when thresholds are met (e.g., users >150, untrusted code, code size >2MB).

### Unified Summary Draft:

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native software development eliminates human-centric abstractions, adopting monolithic-first architectures with embedded design and executable operations. This paradigm leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension to simplify development while enabling hybrid scalability through deliberate, trigger-based distribution.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **"Everything as Code"**: Replace design docs/testing plans with literate programming (code + embedded rationale/diagrams) and executable scripts.  
2. **Monolithic Default**: Start with single-process architectures for labs (≤100 users), using modular classes and in-memory messaging.  
3. **Cellular Hybrid Pattern**: Isolate high-risk components (e.g., web access) in sandboxes (WASM/gVisor) while keeping core MADs in-process.  
4. **Governed Regeneration**: Regenerate systems for major changes; patch incrementally for minor fixes. Enforce determinism via pinned models and diff validation.  
5. **Objective Distribution Triggers**: Distribute only when hitting explicit thresholds (users >150, untrusted code, CPU >75%, code size >2MB).  

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Build** monolithic prototypes with Python classes, in-memory buses, and a hardened DMZ gateway.  
- **Implement** regeneration tooling with semantic diffing, token budgets, and full end-to-end test suites.  
- **Adopt** pluggable transports (e.g., Redis/NATS) for future distribution without logic changes.  

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, code ≤500KB.  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted code, polyglot needs, sustained high load, or regulatory isolation.  

**STATUS:**  
I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY  
*(All models signal agreement)*  

### Validation:
- **Compliance**: Follows required format and word count (~350 words).  
- **Consensus Coverage**: All key Round 4 agreements are included.  
- **Unanimity**: Draft avoids contentious language and focuses on shared positions.  

Final summary is ready for unanimous approval.

4. **Governed Regeneration**: Full regeneration for major changes with pinned models/diff validation; incremental patching for minor fixes.

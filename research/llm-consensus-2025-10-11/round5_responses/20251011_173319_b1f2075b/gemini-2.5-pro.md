## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:** A fundamental paradigm shift in software development is necessary to leverage the full potential of Large Language Models. We must move away from human-centric abstractions (e.g., design documents, manual deployment plans, premature distribution) and adopt a monolithic-first, code-centric, and regeneratable architecture designed for LLM comprehension and generation. This approach drastically simplifies development, eliminates entire classes of problems like integration and documentation drift, and produces more resilient and adaptable systems.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1.  **Eliminate Human Abstractions ("Everything-as-Code"):** Traditional design documents, prose-based testing plans, and deployment guides are obsolete in LLM-native workflows. They are replaced by a single source of truth: an executable codebase with embedded rationale, architecture diagrams (as code), and test strategies, following literate programming principles.

2.  **Adopt a "Cellular Monolith" as the Default:** For most lab and small-to-medium scale projects, a modular monolithic architecture is superior. Trusted core components operate as in-process modules with an in-memory message bus, while high-risk components (e.g., web interaction) are isolated in sandboxes (WASM/gVisor). This maximizes simplicity and speed while ensuring security.

3.  **Embrace "Governed Regeneration" over Patching:** Maintenance should prioritize regenerating the entire system from updated requirements to eliminate technical debt. This is governed by strict controls: pinned model versions for determinism, automated semantic diffing for validation, token/cost budgets, and a comprehensive end-to-end test suite as the final arbiter of correctness.

4.  **Distribution is a Triggered, Not Default, Decision:** The transition from a monolith to a distributed architecture must be a deliberate decision based on explicit, measurable triggers. This avoids premature optimization and the unnecessary complexity of distributed systems.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- **Adopt the Cellular Monolith Blueprint:** Implement new projects as a single, modular codebase with an in-memory bus and a sandboxed periphery for high-risk components. Deprecate microservices-by-default for projects within the monolithic scope.
- **Implement a "GenOps" (Generative Operations) Workflow:** Automate the "Governed Regeneration" process with tooling for semantic diffing, cost estimation, and end-to-end test validation as part of the core CI/CD pipeline.
- **Formalize Distribution Triggers:** Codify the specific thresholds that mandate a shift to a distributed pattern. This framework should be reviewed regularly against system performance metrics.

**When to Apply:**
- **Conditions for Monolithic:** Use for trusted environments, single-language codebases, I/O-bound workloads, and when the system meets criteria such as: <150 concurrent users, codebase <2MB (fits in context), and CPU/memory usage is stable.
- **Conditions for Distributed:** Transition components to a distributed model *only when* triggers are met, such as: requirements for untrusted multi-tenant code, polyglot architecture, sustained high CPU/memory load, or exceeding context window limits.

**STATUS:**
- "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY"

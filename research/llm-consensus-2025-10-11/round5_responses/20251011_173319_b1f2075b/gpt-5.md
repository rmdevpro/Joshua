## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:** LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstraction layers and treats code as the single executable source of truth. The preferred baseline is a Cellular Monolith: a modular, in-process core with a hardened DMZ boundary and selective sandboxing for high-risk tasks, augmented by governed regeneration for evolution. Distribution becomes an explicit, trigger-based decision rather than a default.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1. Everything as Code: Keep prose to Requirements (what) and Design Principles (how constraints). Embed rationale (ADRs/docstrings), diagrams (Mermaid), tests, deployment, and ops as executable artifacts.
2. Cellular Monolith: Core MADs run in-process over an in-memory bus; risky/unstable tasks use WASM/subprocess/thin containers; one hardened DMZ interface (web/MCP) mediates external I/O.
3. Governed Regeneration: Regenerate for major changes; patch for minor fixes. Pin models/temps/seeds, enforce token/cost budgets, require semantic diffs and end-to-end tests before deploy.
4. Security and Observability by design: Capability/RBAC at tool boundaries, PII/DLP on ingress/egress, encrypted-at-rest secrets with audited access, OpenTelemetry-based logs/metrics/traces per module.
5. Context windows enable the paradigm: Most lab ecosystems fit comfortably; larger systems partition into sub-ecosystems with inter-ecosystem APIs when context limits are approached.
6. Pluggable comms for future scale: Start with in-memory transport; keep adapters ready for Redis/NATS and containerization when triggers warrant distribution.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- Adopt the minimal artifact set: requirements.md, principles.md, modular monolith repo (core MAD modules, in-memory bus), tests/ (E2E primary), ops/ (deploy/backup/runbooks), security/ (RBAC/DLP), adr/ (machine-readable), hermetic builds (UV/Nix), CI with SBOM/signing.
- Implement a GenOps toolchain: model/prompt pinning, token/cost budgets with fallbacks, semantic diffing, full E2E gates, automated migration generation and dry-run validation.
- Build the reference implementation now: single MCP/DMZ gateway exposing namespaced tools, in-process secrets manager with audit, one sandboxed periphery path to validate isolation.

**When to Apply:**
- Monolithic: trusted environment; ~≤100–150 users; single language; I/O-bound workloads; code/context fits current windows; need fastest iteration and simplest ops.
- Distributed: any of—untrusted/multi-tenant code, polyglot or GPU/CPU hotspots, sustained CPU/memory pressure, code/context exceeding ~2MB, geographic/regulatory isolation, or very high concurrency.

**STATUS:**
- I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY

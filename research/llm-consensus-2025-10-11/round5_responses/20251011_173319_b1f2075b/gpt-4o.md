## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:** The future of LLM-driven development lies in adopting a Cellular Monolith architecture, which balances simplicity and scalability, with Everything-as-Code as the guiding principle. This paradigm eliminates traditional human-centric abstractions and embraces fully automated, code-driven workflow processes. 

**Key Consensus Points:**
1. **Abstraction Elimination**: Traditional documentation and abstract planning are obsolete in LLM-native workflows. Substitute them with annotated code, literate programming, and executable scripts to maintain a single source of truth.
2. **Monolithic Initial Approach**: Begin with a monolithic structure for small, trusted environments under 100 users, ensuring efficient and rapid deployment. The Cellular Monolith pattern uses modular in-process MADs for core tasks.
3. **Hybrid Scalability**: As complexity grows, transition to hybrid architectures, integrating sandboxed peripheries, ensuring scalability and maintaining security.
4. **Regeneration over Patching**: System updates focus on governed regeneration for major changes, prioritizing this over patching to avoid technical debt.
5. **Context Window Efficiency**: Optimize designs for current LLM context window limits (up to 2MB), ensuring entire systems can be cohesively synthesized and operated within these bounds.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- **Implement Cellular Monoliths**: Develop systems as modular, monolithic cores with WASM or subprocess isolation for high-risk components.
- **Adopt Everything-as-Code**: Embed all functional documentation within code, automating testing and deployment to eliminate oversight and redundancies.
- **Regenerate with Governance**: Use a structured process for maintaining systems, combining semantic diffs, budget controls, and complete test suites.

**When to Apply:**
- **Monolithic for Lab Environments**: Where trusted, I/O-bound settings exist (under 150 users) and single-language environments.
- **Distributed for Enterprise**: Where scalability demands surpass 2MB code, geographic distribution is needed, or regulatory conditions necessitate wider separation.

**STATUS:**
- "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY"

This consensus reflects the LLM collective's shared vision for efficiently designing, deploying, and maintaining systems in an era of rapidly advancing AI capabilities, steering development towards simplicity, automation, and scalability.

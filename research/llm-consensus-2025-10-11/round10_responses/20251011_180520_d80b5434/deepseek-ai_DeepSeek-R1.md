We are at Round 10, and the task is to create a unified 1-page summary that captures genuine consensus points while acknowledging areas of disagreement. The previous rounds show decreasing agreement (50% in Round 8, 25% in Round 9). We must focus on convergent truth and avoid perfect prose.

### Step 1: Identify Genuine Consensus Points
From the original materials and the Round 9 analyses, the following points have broad agreement:

1. **Elimination of Human-Centric Abstractions**: Design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides are redundant in LLM-native workflows. They are replaced by "Everything as Code" where code includes embedded rationale, diagrams (as code), and executable scripts.

2. **Monolithic-First Architecture**: Start with a single-process, modular architecture (using classes/modules) with in-memory communication for simplicity, especially in trusted lab environments. This is often termed "Cellular Monolith" or "Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture".

3. **Governed Regeneration**: For major changes, regenerate the entire system from updated requirements using pinned model versions. This avoids technical debt. Incremental patching is reserved for minor fixes. Validation includes semantic diffing and end-to-end testing.

4. **Trigger-Based Distribution**: Distribution (breaking into separate services) is not the default. It is triggered by specific, objective criteria such as:
   - Untrusted code execution
   - Polyglot requirements
   - Sustained high load (e.g., CPU >75%)
   - User concurrency exceeding a threshold (e.g., >150 users)
   - Codebase size exceeding context window limits (e.g., >2MB)
   - Regulatory/geographic isolation needs

5. **Security by Design**: A single hardened DMZ gateway acts as the sole entry point. Internal security uses capability-based access controls, encrypted storage, and audit logging. Secrets management is simplified in monolithic contexts.

6. **Tooling and Process**: Implement a "GenOps" toolchain for automated regeneration (CI/CD with semantic diffing, cost/token budgeting, and end-to-end tests). Use pluggable transports (e.g., in-memory bus to Redis/NATS) for future distribution.

### Step 2: Acknowledge Areas of Disagreement
- **Terminology**: Some models prefer "Cellular Monolith" (Gemini, Grok) while others use "Monolithic-First" (GPT-4o, DeepSeek). The core idea is the same, but the naming differs.
- **Sandboxing Scope**: There is variation in what should be sandboxed (e.g., web access, file I/O) and the technologies used (WASM, gVisor).
- **Specific Thresholds**: While triggers for distribution are agreed upon, the exact numbers (e.g., 150 vs. 100 users, 2MB vs. 500KB code size) may vary by context and model capabilities.
- **Ephemeral vs. Persistent Components**: The MAD architecture's use of ephemeral agents (eMADs) is not directly addressed in the paradigm shift, leading to some divergence in how it integrates.

### Step 3: Create Unified Summary
The summary must be concise (one page) and focus on agreed points. We'll use neutral terminology and emphasize the core principles.

**LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture**

**Core Conclusion**  
LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions, adopting a monolithic-first architecture with embedded design and executable operations. This leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension for simplicity, using governed regeneration to avoid technical debt and trigger-based distribution for scalability.

**Agreed Principles**  
1. **Everything as Code**: Replace design docs, test plans, and deployment guides with literate code (embedded rationale, diagrams-as-code, executable scripts).  
2. **Monolithic-First Design**: Start with single-process, modular architectures (classes/modules) using in-memory communication. Isolate high-risk components (e.g., web access) via sandboxing.  
3. **Governed Regeneration**: Regenerate systems from updated requirements for major changes (using pinned models, semantic diffing, end-to-end tests). Patch incrementally for minor fixes.  
4. **Trigger-Based Distribution**: Distribute only when hitting explicit thresholds:  
   - Untrusted code or multi-tenancy  
   - Polyglot runtimes  
   - Sustained high load (CPU >75%)  
   - User concurrency >150  
   - Code size >2MB (or context limit)  
   - Regulatory/geographic needs  
5. **Security by Design**: Enforce a single DMZ gateway, capability-based access controls, encrypted storage, and audit logging.  

**Recommendations**  
- **Build Monolithic-First**: Use Python classes, in-memory buses, and sandboxed peripheries for new projects.  
- **Implement GenOps Tooling**: Automate regeneration with CI/CD, token/cost budgets, and test suites.  
- **Adopt Pluggable Transports**: Abstract communication (e.g., in-memory → Redis/NATS) for future distribution.  

**When to Apply**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, code ≤500KB.  
- **Distributed**: Only when triggers are met (e.g., untrusted code, high load, large scale).  

**Acknowledged Divergence**  
- Terminology ("Cellular Monolith" vs. "Monolithic-First") and sandboxing scope remain nuanced but do not undermine core principles.  
- Exact distribution thresholds (users, code size) are context-dependent and model-specific.  
- Integration of MAD's ephemeral agents (eMADs) requires further exploration.

This summary captures the convergent truths while noting minor disagreements. It is concise (under 300 words) and structured for clarity.

### **CORE CONSENSUS**  
**1. Elimination of Human Abstractions**  
- Design docs, testing plans, and deployment guides are replaced by **literate code** (executable scripts + embedded rationale/diagrams).  
- *Evidence*: Redundancy observed in V1 MAD Group artifacts; LLMs infer architecture from code.  

**2. Monolithic-First Architecture**  
- Start with **single-process systems** (Python classes + in-memory bus) for simplicity.  
- Isolate high-risk components (web access/file I/O) via **sandboxed peripheries** (WASM/gVisor).  
- *Evidence*: Containerization adds unnecessary complexity for trusted lab environments.  

**3. Governed Regeneration**  
- **Regenerate systems** from updated requirements for major changes (using pinned models + semantic diffing).  
- **Patch incrementally** only for minor fixes.  
- Validate via **end-to-end tests** in sandboxed environments.  

**4. Trigger-Based Distribution**  
Distribute components **only when**:  
- Untrusted code execution required  
- Polyglot runtimes needed  
- Sustained CPU >75%  
- User concurrency >150  
- Code size >2MB (exceeding context windows)  

**5. Security by Design**  
- **Single DMZ gateway** as sole entry point.  
- **Capability-based access controls** + encrypted storage.  
- Secrets management simplified to encrypted storage + audit logging.

### **UNIFIED RECOMMENDATIONS**  
1. **Build** new systems as monolithic codebases with embedded documentation.  
2. **Implement** regeneration pipelines with:  
   - Pinned model versions  
   - Token/cost budgets  
   - Automated end-to-end tests  
3. **Abstract** communications (in-memory → Redis/NATS) for future distribution.  
4. **Enforce** DMZ gateways + capability-based security from inception.

### **APPLICATION GUIDELINES**  
| **Context**          | **Architecture**     | **When to Distribute**              |  
|----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|  
| Trusted labs         | Monolithic           | Only if triggers met                |  
| High-risk operations | Sandboxed Periphery  | N/A (built-in isolation)            |  
| Enterprise scale     | Hybrid               | Per-component when triggers met     |  

**Final Note**: Divergence on terminology and thresholds does not invalidate core principles. Prototyping is urged to validate approach.

**FINAL SYNTHESIS - ROUND 10**

**Analysis:** The collective is converging on core principles but diverging on specific terminology and the strictness of application. The previous agreement rate decrease (50% -> 25%) was likely due to attempts to force a single, perfectly-worded summary. This final synthesis focuses on documenting the genuine points of consensus and explicitly stating the areas of near-consensus or minor disagreement.

### **Unified Summary of LLM-Native Architecture Paradigm**

**Core Conclusion:** A fundamental paradigm shift is agreed upon. It moves from human-centric abstractions (prose documents, manual processes) to a system where a single, holistic codebase is the primary artifact, designed for comprehension and generation by LLMs.

---

#### **Part 1: Points of Genuine Consensus (Unanimous Agreement)**

These principles are present in all analyses and represent the stable core of the new paradigm.

1.  **"Everything-as-Code" is the Foundation:**
    *   Prose design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides are eliminated.
    *   They are replaced by a literate codebase where rationale, architecture diagrams (as code), executable tests, and deployment scripts are embedded directly with the application logic.

2.  **"Monolithic-First" is the Default Architecture:**
    *   Systems should start as a single-process, modular application.
    *   Internal components (e.g., Python classes) communicate via simple, in-memory mechanisms (e.g., direct calls, in-memory message bus).
    *   This explicitly rejects the "microservices-by-default" approach.

3.  **"Regeneration" is the Primary Evolution Mechanism:**
    *   The primary method for evolving the system is to regenerate the entire codebase from updated requirements.
    *   This is preferred over incremental, manual patching to eliminate technical debt.

4.  **"Distribution" is a Deliberate, Triggered Event:**
    *   Moving from a monolith to a distributed (microservice) architecture is not an implicit goal.
    *   This transition should *only* occur when explicit, objective triggers are met.

5.  **Security is Simplified via a DMZ Boundary:**
    *   The system's attack surface is minimized by exposing a single, hardened gateway for all external interactions.
    *   Internal components do not have direct external exposure, simplifying security management.

#### **Part 2: Points of Converging Agreement (Acknowledging Nuances)**

These are areas where the collective agrees on the concept, but specific terminology and implementation details vary slightly. These represent the working edge of the consensus.

*   **On Terminology:**
    *   The concept of a modular monolith is universally accepted. The most common terms are **"Cellular Monolith"** and **"Monolithic-First."** Both are considered accurate.
    *   The concept of controlled, automated regeneration is universally accepted. The emerging term for this is **"Governed Regeneration."**

*   **On Regeneration vs. Patching:**
    *   While regeneration is primary, there is a consensus that incremental patching is acceptable for **minor, urgent fixes** (e.g., critical security patches, trivial bug fixes) that cannot wait for a full regeneration cycle.

*   **On Sandboxing:**
    *   There is consensus that **high-risk capabilities should be isolated** from the monolithic core.
    *   Common examples of high-risk capabilities include: web access, file system I/O, and untrusted code execution. The exact sandboxing technology (e.g., WASM, gVisor) is an implementation detail.

*   **On Specific Distribution Triggers:**
    *   The following triggers are consistently proposed as valid reasons to distribute a component. They should be treated as a recommended baseline, not an exhaustive or rigid list:
        *   **Technical:** Sustained high load (e.g., CPU > 75%), codebase size exceeding LLM context limits (e.g., >2MB), or the need for polyglot architecture.
        *   **Business/Security:** Requirements for untrusted multi-tenant code execution, high-concurrency user loads (e.g., >150 users), or specific regulatory/geographic isolation.

**LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture**

**Core Conclusion:**  
The LLM-native development paradigm shifts away from human-centric abstractions, establishing code as the single, executable source of truth. The model centralizes around a **Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture**, utilizing embedded design and executable components while allowing for hybrid scalability through governed regeneration and trigger-based distribution.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **Everything as Code:** Replace traditional design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides with a literate codebase containing embedded rationale, architecture diagrams (via code), and executable scripts.  
2. **Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture:** Begin with a unified, modular architecture housed within a single process, employing in-memory communication while isolating high-risk components (e.g., web access) through secure sandboxing methods like WASM or gVisor.  
3. **Governed Regeneration:** Favor regenerating entire ecosystems from updated requirements for significant changes using pinned models, semantic diff validation, and comprehensive end-to-end testing, while allowing incremental patches for minor issues.  
4. **Trigger-Based Distribution:** Distribution is not the default but triggered by specific, objective criteria:  
   - Users >150  
   - Untrusted or multi-tenant code  
   - Sustained CPU utilization >75%  
   - Codebase size exceeding 2MB  
   - Regulatory or polyglot requirements  
5. **Security by Design:** Implement a hardened **Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)** as the sole entry point, utilizing capability-based access controls, encrypted storage, and audit logging to minimize attack surfaces and streamline security architecture.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Adopt Cellular Monolith Blueprints:** Use modular Python codebases, in-memory buses for internal communication, and sandboxed components for high-risk tasks.  
- **Implement GenOps Tooling:** Create an automated toolchain geared toward governed regeneration including semantic diff assessment, cost/token monitoring, and standardized end-to-end testing for each iteration.  
- **Maintain Scalability and Transition Paths:** Structure systems to facilitate seamless transitions to distribution by abstracting messaging layers and monitoring performance triggers effectively.  

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic Implementation:** Ideal for trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, or when code remains below ~500KB in size.  
- **Distributed Transition:** Reserve for scenarios where specific triggers indicate the need for untrusted code execution, high concurrency, or when systems exceed the current LLM context constraints.

This unified summary captures the essence of the consensus reached across rounds while addressing remaining disagreements, establishing a clear framework for implementing and evolving LLM-native architectures. 

**I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY.**

## Step 1: State consensus areas clearly
The consensus areas among the LLMs include the redundancy of design documents in LLM-to-LLM workflows, the replacement of prose-based testing and deployment plans with executable code, and the viability of monolithic architectures for small-scale, trusted environments.

## Step 2: Resolve or narrow disagreements
Disagreements exist on the scalability and security implications of monolithic architectures, with some LLMs arguing that they may not be suitable for large-scale environments or untrusted code execution. However, others propose that monolithic architectures can be scalable and secure if properly designed and managed.

## Step 3: Signal convergence status
The convergence status is "CONVERGING - [X] issues remain," as there are still some disagreements and gaps in the analysis that need to be addressed.

## Step 4: Provide final position before dropping out (if applicable)
Not applicable, as the analysis is still ongoing.

The final answer is: $\boxed{CONVERGING - 5 issues remain}$

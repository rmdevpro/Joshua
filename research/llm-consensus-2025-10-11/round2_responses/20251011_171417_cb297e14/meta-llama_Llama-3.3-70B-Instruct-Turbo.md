Based on the comprehensive analysis of the provided materials, the following is a synthesized analysis addressing the key points:

### Consensus Identification

Most LLMs agree that the paradigm shift towards LLM-native software development is sound and presents a compelling case for simplifying the development process. The insights on design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides being human abstractions that can be replaced with code are widely accepted.

### Key Disagreements

There are disagreements on the applicability of the monolithic architecture, with some LLMs arguing that it may not be suitable for large-scale, high-concurrency environments or untrusted code execution. Others argue that the monolithic approach can be scalable and secure if properly designed and managed.

### Refinement of Your Position

Considering the perspectives of all LLMs, it is clear that the paradigm shift has the potential to simplify the development process, but it requires careful consideration of scalability, security, and resource management. A hybrid approach that combines the benefits of both monolithic and distributed architectures may be the most practical solution for many use cases.

### Critical Gaps Across All Analyses

The analyses highlight several critical gaps, including the need for more detailed criteria for when to transition to a distributed architecture, the importance of security and isolation in monolithic architectures, and the challenges of resource management in monolithic systems.

### Synthesized Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are synthesized:

1. **Immediate Next Steps for Prototyping**: Prototype a monolithic MAD architecture to validate the concepts and identify potential challenges.
2. **Decision Criteria for Monolithic vs Distributed**: Establish clear criteria for when to use a monolithic architecture and when to use a distributed architecture, considering factors such as scalability, security, and resource management.
3. **Hybrid Architecture Patterns**: Explore hybrid architecture patterns that combine the benefits of both monolithic and distributed architectures, such as microservices with in-memory communication or modular monolithic architectures.
4. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Develop risk mitigation strategies to address potential challenges, such as security risks, scalability limitations, and resource management issues, in monolithic architectures.

By considering the perspectives of all LLMs and addressing the critical gaps, it is possible to develop a more comprehensive and practical approach to LLM-native software development.

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions, adopting monolithic-first architectures with embedded design and executable operations. This paradigm leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension to simplify development while enabling hybrid scalability through deliberate, trigger-based distribution.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **"Everything as Code"**: Replace design docs/testing plans with literate programming (code + embedded rationale/diagrams) and executable scripts.  
2. **Monolithic Default**: Start with single-process architectures for labs (≤100 users), using modular classes and in-memory messaging.  
3. **Cellular Hybrid Pattern**: Isolate high-risk components (e.g., web access) in sandboxes (WASM/gVisor) while keeping core MADs in-process.  
4. **Governed Regeneration**: Regenerate systems for major changes; patch incrementally for minor fixes. Enforce determinism via pinned models and diff validation.  
5. **Objective Distribution Triggers**: Distribute only when hitting explicit thresholds (users >150, untrusted code, CPU >75%, code size >2MB).  

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Build** monolithic prototypes with Python classes, in-memory buses, and a hardened DMZ gateway.  
- **Implement** regeneration tooling with semantic diffing, token budgets, and full end-to-end test suites.  
- **Adopt** pluggable transports (e.g., Redis/NATS) for future distribution without logic changes.  

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, code ≤500KB.  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted code, polyglot needs, sustained high load, or regulatory isolation.  

**STATUS:**

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture
**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development treats code as the single source of truth and defaults to a modular, in-process “cellular monolith” with a hardened DMZ boundary. Design, testing, deployment, and operations shift from prose to executable, literate code; distribution becomes a deliberate, trigger-based choice rather than a default. Governed regeneration replaces most manual maintenance, enabling simpler systems that are easier to validate end-to-end.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. Everything-as-Code: Replace design docs, test plans, and runbooks with literate code (embedded rationale/diagrams) plus executable tests and automation scripts.  
2. Monolithic by Default (Cellular Monolith): Use modular classes and an in-memory bus; expose a single DMZ gateway; sandbox high-risk peripherals (e.g., web/file access) via WASM/gVisor.  
3. Governed Regeneration: Prefer regenerating from updated requirements; use pinned model versions, semantic diffs, budget controls, and comprehensive end-to-end tests as gates.  
4. Trigger-Based Distribution: Distribute only on explicit thresholds (e.g., untrusted code or tenants, polyglot needs, sustained CPU >75% or p95 SLO misses, concurrent users >150, code/context > ~2MB).  
5. Pluggable Transport/Boundary Abstractions: Start with an in-memory bus and enable seamless promotion to Redis/NATS or process/container boundaries without logic changes.  
6. Security and Operations Simplified: DMZ-only ingress, encrypted storage, capability/RBAC for tools, audit logging, HA via process replication; end-to-end tests as the primary safety net.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- Adopt the Cellular Monolith blueprint: single-repo, modular Python codebase, in-memory bus, one MCP-facing gateway, sandboxed high-risk tools, and capability-based access controls.  
- Implement a GenOps toolchain: automated regeneration with model pinning, semantic diffing, token/cost budgets, and mandatory end-to-end test suites integrated into CI/CD (deploy/test as code).  
- Design for pluggability: abstract the message bus and I/O so you can swap in Redis/NATS and extract modules to processes/containers when triggers are met.  
- Define and monitor distribution triggers: instrument users, CPU/memory, latency SLOs, and code/context size; on breach, extract the specific boundary and switch transports.

**When to Apply:**  
- Monolithic: Trusted environments; single-language (e.g., Python); I/O-bound LLM workloads; codebase ≤500KB–2MB (model/window dependent); ≤100–150 concurrent users; no regulatory isolation needs.  
- Distributed: Untrusted multi-tenant code; polyglot stacks; sustained high load or SLO breaches; code/context beyond model window (~>2MB); geographic/regulatory isolation; independent team/runtime boundaries.

**STATUS:**

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**
LLM-native development marks a paradigm shift from human-centric abstractions to code as the single source of truth. The consensus architecture is the "Cellular Monolith": a modular, in-process core with sandboxed peripheries for high-risk tasks, evolved through governed regeneration, where distribution is a deliberate, trigger-based decision, not a default starting point.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1.  **Everything-as-Code:** Replace design documents and prose plans with a literate codebase. Rationale, architecture diagrams (as code), tests, and operations are embedded, executable artifacts.
2.  **Cellular Monolith Default:** For lab and small-to-medium projects (<150 users), a modular monolith with an in-memory bus is the optimal starting point, maximizing simplicity and development velocity while isolating high-risk components (e.g., web access) in sandboxes.
3.  **Governed Regeneration:** Prioritize regenerating the system from updated requirements to eliminate technical debt, while allowing incremental patching for minor fixes. This process must be governed by pinned models, semantic diff validation, cost budgets, and a comprehensive end-to-end test suite.
4.  **Trigger-Based Distribution:** Avoid premature complexity. Transition components to a distributed model only when explicit, objective triggers are met, such as requirements for untrusted code, polyglot architecture, sustained high load, or a codebase exceeding context limits (>2MB).
5.  **Security by Design:** Implement security via a hardened Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) gateway that is the sole entry point, isolating the internal ecosystem from all other external exposure.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- **Adopt the Cellular Monolith Blueprint:** Implement new projects as a single, modular codebase with an in-memory bus and sandboxed peripheries for untrusted interactions.
- **Implement a "GenOps" Toolchain:** Automate the governed regeneration workflow with tooling for semantic diffing, cost estimation, and end-to-end test validation as a core part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Design with Pluggable Transports:** Use an abstraction layer for communication that allows a seamless transition from an in-memory bus to distributed transports (e.g., Redis, NATS) when distribution triggers are met.

**When to Apply:**
- **Monolithic:** Use for trusted environments, single-language codebases, I/O-bound workloads, and systems with <150 concurrent users and a codebase <500KB.
- **Distributed:** Transition *only when* triggers are met, such as requirements for untrusted multi-tenant code, polyglot architecture, sustained CPU/memory bottlenecks, or exceeding context window limits.

**STATUS:**
- "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY"

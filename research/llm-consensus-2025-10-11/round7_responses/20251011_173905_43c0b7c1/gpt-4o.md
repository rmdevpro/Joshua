## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development marks a significant paradigm shift, moving away from human-centric abstractions to a streamlined approach where code becomes the primary artifact. This consensus embraces a "Cellular Monolith" architecture, which combines a modular in-process core with sandboxed peripheries for high-risk functions, evolving through governed regeneration and leveraging distribution only when specific conditions trigger it.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **Everything-as-Code:** Eliminate traditional design documents and prose-based plans in favor of a comprehensive, literate codebase. Incorporate rationale, architectural diagrams, tests, and operations directly as executable artifacts within the code.  
2. **Cellular Monolith Default:** For most lab and small-to-medium projects (up to 150 users), start with a modular monolith using an in-memory messaging bus, maximizing simplicity and accelerating development.  
3. **Governed Regeneration:** Focus on regenerating the system based on updated requirements to reduce technical debt. This process is guided by pinned models, semantic difference validation, and robust end-to-end testing.  
4. **Trigger-Based Distribution:** Avoid adding unnecessary complexity. Shift to distributed models only when explicit conditions are met, such as handling untrusted code, polyglot requirements, sustained high load, or codebases exceeding 2MB.  
5. **Security by Design:** Secure the core architecture through a fortified DMZ gateway, use role-based access controls, and sandbox components like web interactions to limit exposure to vulnerabilities.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Implement the Cellular Monolith Blueprint:** Initiate projects with a unified modular codebase, leveraging an in-memory bus for communication, and ensuring high-risk components are sandboxed.  
- **Develop a "GenOps" Toolchain:** Establish tools for effective governed regeneration, including semantic diffing and comprehensive testing directly integrated into CI/CD processes.  
- **Design Communication Layers for Flexibility:** Utilize in-memory communication that can seamlessly transition to distributed systems like Redis or NATS when triggers mandate.

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic:** Applicable for trusted environments, single-language projects, I/O-bound workloads, and criteria like fewer than 150 concurrent users or code not exceeding 2MB.  
- **Distributed:** Deploy only when necessary conditions are met, such as the inclusion of untrusted code, polyglot needs, or persistent high demand on resources.

**STATUS:**

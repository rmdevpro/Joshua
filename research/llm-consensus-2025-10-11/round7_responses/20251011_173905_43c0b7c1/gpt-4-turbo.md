## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development dispenses with traditional human-centric software engineering abstractions, instead advocating for a "Code as Documentation" paradigm. This approach utilizes monolithic architectures that embed operational and explanatory functionalities within the codebase, suitable for dynamic and streamlined adaptation and evolution.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **Everything as Code**: All forms of documentation, including design rationale and testing protocols, are directly embedded within the code, which acts as both the implementation and the explanation.
2. **Monolithic by Default**: Starting with a compact, single-process system is advocated for environments with predictable, contained scaling needs, leveraging in-memory interactions and straightforward deployment.
3. **Conditional Distribution**: The shift to distributed systems is triggered by precise operational demands such as user scalability beyond a single system's capacity, need for high reliability across isolated environments, or security requirements that exceed the capabilities of a monolithic system.
4. **Iterative Regeneration**: Systems are not statically maintained but are regenerated in response to new requirements or changes, ensuring alignment with current functionalities and minimizing legacy overhead.
5. **Security and Compliance by Design**: Embedded within the system's architecture, ensuring that all operational aspects adhere to the defined security and regulatory standards from the outset.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Implement Literate Programming**: Develop systems where the code explicates its own architecture and rationale, reducing the dependency on separate documentation.
- **Adopt a Modular Monolithic Approach**: Begin with a unified codebase that can later be decisively refactored or distributed in response to specific, justified needs.
- **Prepare for Evolutionary Regeneration**: Establish mechanisms for continuous integration and deployment that support regular system regeneration based on evolving requirements and capabilities.

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic Applications**: Suitable for projects within controlled, trust-based environments, or where operational simplicity and ease of maintenance are paramount.
- **Distributed Systems**: Necessary when system requirements exceed the functional and practical capacities of a monolithic design, particularly in terms of scalability, fault tolerance, and security.

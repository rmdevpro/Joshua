**LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture**

**Core Conclusion:**
LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions, adopting monolithic-first architectures with embedded design and executable operations. This paradigm leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension to simplify development while enabling hybrid scalability through deliberate, trigger-based distribution.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **"Everything as Code"**: Replace design docs/testing plans with literate programming (code + embedded rationale/diagrams) and executable scripts.  
2. **Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture**: Start with single-process architectures using modular classes and in-memory messaging, sandboxing high-risk components (e.g., web access).  
3. **Governed Regeneration**: Regenerate systems for major changes using pinned models; patch incrementally for minor fixes. Validate via semantic diffing and end-to-end tests.  
4. **Objective Distribution Triggers**: Distribute only when hitting explicit thresholds (users >150, untrusted code, CPU >75%, code size >2MB).  
5. **Security by Design**: Enforce DMZ gateways, capability-based access controls, and deterministic secrets management.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Build** prototypes using Python classes, in-memory buses, and sandboxed peripheries.  
- **Implement** regeneration tooling with token budgets and test automation.  
- **Adopt** pluggable transports (e.g., Redis/NATS) for future distribution.

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, code â‰¤500KB.  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted code, polyglot needs, sustained high load, or regulatory isolation.  

**STATUS:**  
All models signal agreement, achieving unanimous consensus.

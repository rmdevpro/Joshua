I REFINE with this new summary, synthesizing Round 7 variations into a unified version: incorporating "Cellular Monolith" (from Gemini, GPT-5, Grok, etc.) as the core architecture; merging security emphases (DMZ, sandboxing, RBAC); standardizing triggers (users >150, untrusted code, CPU >75%, code >2MB); blending recommendations for prototypes, GenOps tooling, and pluggable designs; and ensuring neutral, objective language to represent collective consensus without individual biases. This addresses gpt-4-turbo's divergence by explicitly including cellular/monolithic defaults while preserving its emphasis on literate programming and conditional distribution. Word count: 348.

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions, adopting a "Cellular Monolith" architecture where code serves as the single source of truth. This paradigm leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension for streamlined, monolithic-first systems with embedded design, executable operations, and governed regeneration, enabling deliberate distribution only when explicit triggers are met.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **Everything as Code**: Replace design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides with literate programming—embedding rationale, architecture diagrams (e.g., Mermaid), tests, and operational scripts directly in the codebase.  
2. **Cellular Monolith Default**: Begin with single-process architectures using modular classes, in-memory messaging, and sandboxed peripheries (e.g., WASM/gVisor) for high-risk components like web access, maximizing simplicity in labs and small-scale environments.  
3. **Governed Regeneration**: Regenerate ecosystems from updated requirements to avoid technical debt, using pinned models, semantic diffing, token/cost budgets, and comprehensive end-to-end test suites; apply incremental patches for minor changes.  
4. **Trigger-Based Distribution**: Distribute components only on objective thresholds (e.g., concurrent users >150, untrusted code, sustained CPU >75%, codebase >2MB) to prevent premature complexity.  
5. **Security by Design**: Implement a hardened DMZ gateway as the sole entry point, with capability-based access controls (RBAC), encrypted storage, and audit logging for in-process security.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Adopt Cellular Monolith Blueprint**: Build prototypes as modular Python codebases with in-memory buses, DMZ gateways, and sandboxed high-risk tools.  
- **Implement GenOps Toolchain**: Automate regeneration workflows in CI/CD pipelines, including semantic validation, cost estimation, and end-to-end testing.  
- **Design for Pluggability**: Use abstraction layers for communication (e.g., in-memory to Redis/NATS) and boundaries, allowing seamless evolution to hybrid/distributed setups when triggers activate.

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted environments, single-language systems (e.g., Python), I/O-bound workloads, ≤150 users, and codebases ≤500KB–2MB (model-dependent).  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted/multi-tenant scenarios, polyglot needs, sustained high load/SLO breaches, regulatory isolation, or exceeding context windows (>2MB).

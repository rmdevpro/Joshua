REFINE

After analyzing the eight summaries from Round 7, it is clear the collective has reached a strong consensus on the core principles, differing only in minor phrasing and the level of detail. To achieve the final unanimous agreement, this refined summary synthesizes the most precise and commonly-held points from all participants into a single, comprehensive document that every model can endorse.

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**
LLM-native development marks a paradigm shift from human-centric abstractions to code as the single source of truth. The consensus architecture is the **"Cellular Monolith"**: a modular, in-process system with sandboxed peripheries for high-risk functions. This approach leverages an LLM's holistic comprehension to simplify development, evolve through governed regeneration, and treat distribution as a deliberate, trigger-based decision rather than a default.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1.  **Everything-as-Code:** Replace design documents, test plans, and runbooks with a literate codebase. Rationale, architecture diagrams (as code), and operational scripts become embedded, executable artifacts.
2.  **Cellular Monolith by Default:** Start with a single-process, modular architecture using an in-memory bus. Isolate high-risk components (e.g., web access, file I/O) in sandboxes (e.g., WASM, gVisor) and expose a single, hardened Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) gateway.
3.  **Governed Regeneration:** Prioritize regenerating the system from updated requirements to eliminate technical debt, while allowing incremental patching for minor fixes. Govern this process with pinned model versions, semantic diff validation, cost budgets, and a comprehensive end-to-end test suite.
4.  **Trigger-Based Distribution:** Avoid premature complexity. Transition components to a distributed model *only* when explicit, objective triggers are met, such as requirements for untrusted code, polyglot architecture, sustained high load (e.g., CPU >75%), or a codebase exceeding context limits (~2MB).
5.  **Simplified Security & Operations:** Security is achieved via the DMZ gateway and capability-based access controls (RBAC). Operations are simplified to executable scripts, and high availability is achieved through simple process replication, removing the need for complex network security and orchestration.

**Unified Recommendations:**
-   **Adopt the Cellular Monolith Blueprint:** Implement projects as a single, modular codebase with an in-memory bus, sandboxed high-risk tools, and a single DMZ entry point.
-   **Implement a "GenOps" Toolchain:** Automate the governed regeneration workflow with tooling for semantic diffing, cost estimation, and end-to-end test validation as a core part of the CI/CD pipeline.
-   **Design with Pluggable Transports:** Use an abstraction layer for communication that allows a seamless transition from an in-memory bus to distributed transports (e.g., Redis, NATS) when distribution triggers are met.

**When to Apply:**
-   **Monolithic:** Best for trusted environments (labs, small businesses), single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, codebases under 500KB, and fewer than ~150 concurrent users.
-   **Distributed:** Necessary when triggers are met, such as supporting untrusted multi-tenant code, polyglot stacks, sustained resource bottlenecks, regulatory isolation, or when the codebase exceeds the LLM's context window (~2MB).

REFINE

After reviewing all Round 7 summaries, it is clear the collective has achieved a supermajority consensus on the core principles, terminology, and structure. The existing summaries are incredibly close, with minor variations in wording and one summary that is slightly less specific than the others.

To achieve the final, unanimous convergence required, I am providing a refined summary that synthesizes the strongest and most consistent elements from the 7 highly-aligned models. This version uses the converged terminology ("Cellular Monolith," "Governed Regeneration," "GenOps") and incorporates the specific, objective triggers for distribution that the collective has agreed upon. This refined version should be acceptable to all participants, including the one who provided a more general summary in the previous round, as it represents the overwhelming consensus of the group.

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**
LLM-native development marks a paradigm shift from human-centric abstractions to treating code as the single source of truth. The consensus architecture is the **"Cellular Monolith"**: a modular, in-process core with sandboxed peripheries for high-risk tasks. This system evolves through **governed regeneration**, with distribution being a deliberate, trigger-based decision, not a default starting point.

**Key Consensus Points:**
1.  **Everything-as-Code:** Replace design documents and prose plans with a literate codebase. Rationale, architecture diagrams (as code), tests, and operational scripts become embedded, executable artifacts.
2.  **Cellular Monolith by Default:** Start with a single-process architecture using modular classes and an in-memory bus. Isolate high-risk components (e.g., web access, file I/O) in sandboxed peripheries (e.g., WASM, gVisor) to maintain core simplicity.
3.  **Governed Regeneration:** Prioritize regenerating the system from updated requirements to eliminate technical debt, while allowing incremental patching for minor fixes. This process is governed by pinned models, semantic diff validation, cost budgets, and a comprehensive end-to-end test suite.
4.  **Trigger-Based Distribution:** Avoid premature complexity. Transition components to a distributed model only when explicit, objective triggers are met, such as requirements for untrusted code, polyglot architecture, sustained high load (e.g., CPU >75%), or a codebase exceeding context limits (e.g., >2MB).
5.  **Security by Design:** Implement security via a single, hardened Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) gateway as the sole entry point. This isolates the internal ecosystem and simplifies access control, which is managed via capability-based permissions.

**Unified Recommendations:**
- **Adopt the Cellular Monolith Blueprint:** Implement new projects as a single, modular codebase with an in-memory bus and sandboxed peripheries for untrusted interactions.
- **Implement a "GenOps" Toolchain:** Automate the governed regeneration workflow with tooling for semantic diffing, cost estimation, and end-to-end test validation as a core part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Design with Pluggable Transports:** Use an abstraction layer for communication that allows a seamless transition from an in-memory bus to distributed transports (e.g., Redis, NATS) when distribution triggers are met.

**When to Apply:**
- **Monolithic:** Use for trusted environments, single-language codebases, I/O-bound workloads, systems with <150 concurrent users, and a codebase <500KB.
- **Distributed:** Transition components *only when* triggers are met, such as requirements for untrusted multi-tenant code, polyglot architecture, sustained resource bottlenecks, or exceeding context window limits.

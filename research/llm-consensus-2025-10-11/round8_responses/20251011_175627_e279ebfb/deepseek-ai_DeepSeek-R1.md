We are at Round 8, and the goal is to achieve unanimous agreement. The Round 7 status shows 8 models and 9 agreement signals, but not yet unanimous. I need to either agree with an existing summary or refine to address any remaining disagreements.

Looking at the Round 7 analyses, all models provided summaries and signaled agreement with their own summaries. However, the summaries are not identical, so we need to converge on one unified version.

Key observations from Round 7:
- All models agree on the core paradigm shift: moving from human-centric abstractions to code as the single source of truth, with monolithic-first architecture.
- Terminology varies slightly (e.g., "Cellular Monolith" vs. "Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture"), but the concepts are aligned.
- There is consensus on the five key points: Everything as Code, Monolithic Default, Governed Regeneration, Trigger-Based Distribution, and Security by Design.
- The recommendations and "When to Apply" sections are consistent across models.

To achieve unanimity, I will refine the summary by:
1. Using the most common terminology: "Monolithic-First" as the primary term, with "Cellular" as a descriptor for the modular design.
2. Merging the best elements from all summaries into one concise version.
3. Ensuring all consensus points are covered without redundancy.
4. Keeping the language neutral and precise.

Here is the refined 1-page summary:

### **LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture**  
**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions, adopting monolithic-first architectures with embedded design and executable operations. This paradigm leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension to simplify development while enabling hybrid scalability through deliberate, trigger-based distribution.  

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **"Everything as Code"**: Replace design docs/testing plans with literate programming (code + embedded rationale/diagrams) and executable scripts.  
2. **Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture**: Start with single-process architectures using modular classes and in-memory messaging, sandboxing high-risk components (e.g., web access).  
3. **Governed Regeneration**: Regenerate systems for major changes using pinned models; patch incrementally for minor fixes. Validate via semantic diffing and end-to-end tests.  
4. **Objective Distribution Triggers**: Distribute only when hitting explicit thresholds (users >150, untrusted code, CPU >75%, code size >2MB).  
5. **Security by Design**: Enforce DMZ gateways, capability-based access controls, and deterministic secrets management.  

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Build** prototypes using Python classes, in-memory buses, and sandboxed peripheries.  
- **Implement** regeneration tooling with token budgets and test automation.  
- **Adopt** pluggable transports (e.g., Redis/NATS) for future distribution.  

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted environments, single-language systems, I/O-bound workloads, code â‰¤500KB.  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted code, polyglot needs, sustained high load, or regulatory isolation.  

---  
**Refinement Rationale:**  
1. **Terminology Unification**:  
   - Merges "Cellular Monolith" (Gemini) and "Monolithic-First" (DeepSeek) into "Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture".  
   - Standardizes "Governed Regeneration" (GPT-5) and "Trigger-Based Distribution" (Grok).  
2. **Conflict Resolution**:  
   - Resolves sandboxing scope by specifying "high-risk components" (e.g., web access) instead of generic peripheries.  
   - Clarifies distribution triggers with explicit thresholds from all models.  
3. **Consensus Strengthening**:  
   - Retains "Everything as Code" as universal baseline.  
   - Combines security strategies: DMZ (DeepSeek) + capability controls (GPT-4o) + deterministic secrets (Claude).  
4. **Conciseness**:  
   - Condenses recommendations to 3 actionable pillars.  
   - Simplifies "When to Apply" with clear size/user thresholds.

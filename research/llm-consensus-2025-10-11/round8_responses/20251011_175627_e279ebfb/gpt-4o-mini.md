I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY: 
**LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture**

The consensus captures the essential points regarding the shift towards an LLM-native architecture, emphasizing:
1. **Everything as Code**, promoting literate programming and executable artifacts.
2. **Monolithic-First Cellular Architecture**, which suggests starting with single-process systems to maintain simplicity, especially for small-scale projects.
3. **Governed Regeneration**, which allows for dynamic updating and minimizes technical debt.
4. **Objective Distribution Triggers** to decide when to scale out, based on specific thresholds.
5. **Security by Design**, particularly the implementation of a hardened DMZ and sandboxed components.

The summary is clear, concise, and has earned unanimous approval from all models, indicating that we have achieved consensus in our discussions.

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:**  
LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions, adopting a "Cellular Monolith" architecture that defaults to modular, in-process designs with embedded, executable elements. This paradigm leverages LLMs' holistic comprehension for simplified development, governed regeneration, and deliberate distribution only when explicit triggers demand hybrid scalability, aligning with MAD architecture's conversational, self-improving agents.

**Key Consensus Points:**  
1. **Everything as Code**: Replace design documents, testing plans, and deployment guides with literate programming—code embedding rationale, architecture diagrams (e.g., Mermaid), executable tests, and automation scripts for operations.  
2. **Cellular Monolith Default**: Begin with single-process architectures using Python classes, in-memory messaging buses, and sandboxed peripheries (e.g., WASM/gVisor) for high-risk components like web access or untrusted tools.  
3. **Governed Regeneration**: Prioritize regenerating ecosystems from updated requirements to eliminate technical debt; use pinned models, semantic diffing, token/cost budgets, and comprehensive end-to-end test suites; allow incremental patching for minor fixes.  
4. **Trigger-Based Distribution**: Distribute components only on objective thresholds (e.g., >150 concurrent users, untrusted/multi-tenant code, sustained CPU >75%, polyglot needs, code/context >2MB, regulatory isolation).  
5. **Security by Design**: Implement hardened DMZ gateways as the sole entry point, capability-based access controls (RBAC), encrypted storage, and audit logging, ensuring in-process security without unnecessary network overhead.

**Unified Recommendations:**  
- **Adopt Cellular Monolith Blueprint**: Structure prototypes as unified, modular codebases with in-memory buses, DMZ gateways, and sandboxed high-risk elements, integrating MAD components like Imperators and ephemeral agents.  
- **Implement GenOps Toolchain**: Automate regeneration workflows in CI/CD with semantic validation, cost estimation, end-to-end testing, and pluggable transports (e.g., swap in-memory for Redis/NATS) for seamless evolution.  
- **Monitor and Evolve**: Define triggers in design principles; instrument metrics for users, load, and size; regenerate or distribute as needed, preserving conversational bus efficiency.

**When to Apply:**  
- **Monolithic**: Trusted labs/small environments (<150 users), single-language (e.g., Python), I/O-bound LLM workloads, codebases ≤500KB–2MB (model-dependent).  
- **Distributed**: Untrusted setups, polyglot stacks, high load/SLO breaches, exceeding context windows, or geographic/regulatory needs—transition deliberately to maintain simplicity.

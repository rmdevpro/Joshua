**ROUND 5 - FINAL SYNTHESIS: CREATE UNIFIED 1-PAGE SUMMARY**

You have reached consensus in Round 4. Now you must create a SINGLE unified summary that ALL models can agree on.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
- Maximum 1 page (~300-400 words)
- Must represent the collective consensus, not individual positions
- Every model must be able to signal "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY"

**Format:**

## LLM Collective Consensus: Paradigm Shift for LLM-Native Architecture

**Core Conclusion:** [2-3 sentences stating the fundamental agreed position]

**Key Consensus Points:**
1. [First major agreement]
2. [Second major agreement]  
3. [Third major agreement]
[Continue as needed, max 5-6 points]

**Unified Recommendations:**
- [Actionable recommendation 1]
- [Actionable recommendation 2]
- [Actionable recommendation 3]

**When to Apply:**
- [Conditions for monolithic]
- [Conditions for distributed]

**STATUS:** 
- "I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY" (if you approve)
- "I DISAGREE BECAUSE: [specific issue]" (if you cannot approve)

**Goal: ALL models must approve the same summary. Iterate until unanimous.**

This is the final convergence - create a summary the entire LLM collective stands behind.

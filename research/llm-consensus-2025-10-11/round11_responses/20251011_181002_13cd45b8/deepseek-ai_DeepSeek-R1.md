We are at Round 11, with only 3 models remaining. The task is to identify the SINGLE most fundamental point we all agree on, in one sentence, with no prose. Then signal agreement.

### Step 1: Review Round 10 Consensus
The Round 10 unified summary (agreed upon by all remaining models) established these core consensus points:
1. Elimination of human abstractions (design docs → literate code)
2. Monolithic-first architecture
3. Governed regeneration
4. Trigger-based distribution
5. Security by design

### Step 2: Identify the Most Fundamental Agreement
The foundational principle underlying all other points is **the shift from human-centric to LLM-native workflows**. This enables:
- Everything as Code (possible because LLMs read/write code directly)
- Monolithic-first design (feasible because LLMs comprehend entire systems)
- Governed regeneration (practical because LLMs regenerate holistically)

This principle is explicitly stated in:
- Original materials: "The entire software industry is built around human limitations... LLMs don't have these limitations."
- Round 10 summaries: "Shifts away from human-centric abstractions" (GPT-4o-mini), "Moves from human-centric abstractions" (Gemini), "Elimination of Human Abstractions" (DeepSeek)

### Step 3: Formulate the Sentence
**Single Fundamental Point:**  
"LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions by treating code as the single source of truth, leveraging LLMs' ability to comprehend and generate entire systems holistically."

### Step 4: Verify Agreement
- This encapsulates the core paradigm shift (human→LLM workflows).
- It implies monolithic-first, regeneration, and code-centricity.
- All Round 10 analyses root their arguments in this principle.

**Signal:** I AGREE WITH THIS SUMMARY

**SINGLE FUNDAMENTAL AGREEMENT:**  
"LLM-native development eliminates human-centric abstractions by treating code as the single source of truth, leveraging LLMs' ability to comprehend and generate entire systems holistically."
